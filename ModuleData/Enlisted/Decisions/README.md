# Decisions/

Player-initiated actions from the Camp Hub menu.

**Spec:** `docs/Content/content-index.md` §Decisions

---

## How It Works

**Delivery Method:** Player-initiated from Camp Hub menu  
**Trigger:** Player presses 'C' → navigates to category → selects action  
**System:** Loaded by `EventCatalog` → filtered by `DecisionCatalog` → displayed in Camp Hub menu

**Decision Flow:**
```
1. Player opens Camp Hub (C key)
2. Navigates to category (Training, Social, Economic, etc.)
3. Sees available decisions (filtered by tier, cooldown, requirements)
4. Selects decision → sees setup text → chooses option → gets result
5. Cooldown applied, effects processed
```

**Recognition:** Decisions use `dec_` ID prefix (e.g., `dec_rest`, `dec_spar`)

## Not in This Folder

The following are **triggered events** (game-initiated based on conditions), not Camp Hub decisions. They remain in `Events/`:

### Automatic Decision Events (`events_decisions.json`)
**Delivery:** Game triggers as popup inquiry based on conditions  
**Examples:** Lord's hunt invitation, training offers from NCO, quartermaster deals  
**Recognition:** `decision_*` prefix (legacy naming)

### Player-Initiated Event Popups (`events_player_decisions.json`)
**Delivery:** Player initiates from menu, but delivered as popup inquiry  
**Examples:** Organize dice game, request extra training, visit wounded  
**Recognition:** `player_*` prefix  
**Difference from Camp Hub decisions:** These open as popup dialogs rather than inline menu selections
