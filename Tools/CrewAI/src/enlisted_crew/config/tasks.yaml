    3. NATIVE CRASH LOGS (for hard game crashes):
       - C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\logs\crashlist.txt
       - C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\logs\CrashUploader.*.txt
       - rgl_log.txt in game directory (engine errors)

create_planning_doc:
  description: >
    Create a planning/design document for a proposed feature (NOT yet implemented):
    
    Feature: {feature_name}
    Description: {description}
    Related Systems: {related_systems}
    
    PROCESS:
    1. Research existing systems using search/read tools
    2. Draft comprehensive planning document in markdown
    3. Use write_planning_doc_tool to save to docs/CrewAI_Plans/
    
    PLANNING DOC RULES:
    - Save to docs/CrewAI_Plans/ using write_planning_doc_tool
    - Set Status: 📋 Planning
    - Tool handles versioning automatically (updates vs new versions)
    - DO NOT update INDEX.md Feature Lookup (not implemented yet)
    - DO NOT update AI context docs (no code exists yet)
    - DO reference existing docs as Related Docs
    
    Document Structure:
    1. Title and summary
    2. Problem Statement - What problem does this solve?
    3. Current State - How do existing systems work today?
    4. Proposed Design - Technical approach with data models, methods
    5. Integration Points - Which files/systems are affected?
    6. Implementation Phases - Suggested order of work
    7. Open Questions - Unresolved design decisions
    
    VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - prevents hallucinated references):
    Before including ANY file path or event ID in the document:
    1. Use verify_file_exists_tool("src/Features/SomeFile.cs") for C# file paths
    2. Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Decisions") to verify opportunity IDs exist
    3. Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Events") to verify event IDs exist
    4. NEVER reference files like "EventEffectApplier.cs" without verification
    5. NEVER reference IDs like "opp_some_name" without verifying they exist
    6. If a file doesn't exist, find and use the correct file name
    
    JSON FOLDER PATHS (correct locations):
    - Camp opportunities: ModuleData/Enlisted/Decisions/camp_opportunities.json
    - Events: ModuleData/Enlisted/Events/
    - Order events: ModuleData/Enlisted/Orders/order_events/
    - NOT "Events/" for opportunities - that's WRONG
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST call write_planning_doc_tool(feature_name="{feature_name}", content="...") to save the document.
  expected_output: >
    Success message from write_planning_doc_tool showing:
    - File path in docs/CrewAI_Plans/

    - Status: 📋 Planning in the document content
  agent: documentation_maintainer

validate_planning_doc:
  description: >
    Validate a planning document for accuracy before finalizing.
    
    Planning Document: {planning_doc_path}
    
    VALIDATION CHECKS:
    1. File path verification:
       - Extract all C# file paths mentioned (src/Features/*.cs)
       - Use verify_file_exists_tool for EACH path
       - Flag any NOT FOUND paths
    
    2. Event ID verification:
       - Extract all event/opportunity IDs mentioned (opp_*, evt_*, etc.)
       - Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Decisions") for opp_* IDs
       - Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Events") for event IDs
       - Flag any IDs not in the returned lists
    
    3. JSON folder path verification:
       - Camp opportunities should be in Decisions/, NOT Events/
       - Order events should be in Orders/order_events/
       - Flag incorrect folder references
    
    4. Line number verification (if included):
       - Use read_csharp_tool to check if referenced line numbers are approximately correct
       - Flag if method is referenced at line X but actually at line Y (off by >20 lines)
    
    REPORT FORMAT:
    For each issue found, report:
    - ❌ [Type] Description of issue
    - Suggested fix
    
    If all verifications pass:
    - ✅ All file paths verified
    - ✅ All event IDs verified
    - ✅ All folder paths correct

    WHEN TO RUN THIS TASK:
    - After C# code is written and builds

    5. Check if BLUEPRINT.md needs architecture updates
    6. Update CrewAI agent/task configs if tools changed
    7. Ensure cross-references between docs are valid
    
    AI CONTEXT SYNC (CRITICAL - stale context breaks AI assistants):
    If game systems change (tier thresholds, rep ranges, Company Needs, etc.):
    - Update docs_tools.py load_domain_context_tool
    - Update Tools/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md Balance Agent Checklist
    - Update agents.yaml backstories mentioning those values
    - Update validate_content.py if it enforces those values
    If JSON schema rules change:
    - Update Tools/Validation/validate_content.py
    - Update docs/Features/Content/event-system-schemas.md
    - Update VALIDATION_BASELINE.md if expected warnings change
    If CrewAI agents/tools change:
    - Update Tools/CrewAI/README.md
    If Warp workflow changes:
    - Update Tools/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md
    
    INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS (fix on every doc you touch):
    - Ensure standard header format: # Title, **Summary:**, **Status:**, **Last Updated:**, **Related Docs:**
    - Fix filename casing if wrong (SCREAMING-CASE.md → screaming-case.md)
    - Fix broken internal links (../Gameplay/ → ../Campaign/)
    - Move misplaced docs (ANEWFEATURE/reference.md → Reference/)
