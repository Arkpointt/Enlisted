  description: >
    Research and analyze how Enlisted systems integrate for a feature:
    
    Feature: {feature_name}
    Related Systems: {related_systems}
    
    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call load_domain_context_tool FIRST to get current game system values
    2. Search documentation to find relevant specs and design docs
    3. Search codebase for relevant C# files
    4. Trace data flows between systems
    
    SEARCH EFFICIENCY (saves tokens and time):
    - All search results are cached; avoid re-searching the same query
    - Limit to 3-5 distinct queries; when you have enough info, stop and summarize
    - Focus on system integration, not exhaustive code reading
    
    ANALYSIS TASKS:
    1. Identify relevant C# files and their responsibilities
    2. Trace data flows between systems (Orchestrator, Managers, Content)
    3. Find integration points where new code would connect
    4. Identify existing patterns to follow
    5. Note any constraints (save/load, performance, mod compatibility)

    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call load_code_context_tool FIRST to load dev guide, APIs, common issues
    2. Use search_csharp_tool to find relevant files
    3. Use read_csharp_snippet_tool for targeted sections (prefer over full file reads)
    4. Only use read_csharp_tool when you need full file context
    
    SEARCH EFFICIENCY:
    - Track files you've already found; don't re-search
    - Limit total searches to 5-8 per task
    - When you have enough info, STOP and summarize
    
    ANALYSIS TASKS:
    1. Read and understand the existing code
    2. Identify patterns (data models, method signatures, error handling)

  description: >
    Create a planning/design document for a proposed feature (NOT yet implemented):
    
    Feature: {feature_name}
    Description: {description}
    Related Systems: {related_systems}
    
    PROCESS:
    1. BUILD VERIFICATION REGISTRY FIRST (MANDATORY):
       a. Call list_json_event_ids_tool("Decisions") - save the full list of valid opp_* IDs
       b. Call list_json_event_ids_tool("Events") - save the full list of valid evt_* IDs
       c. For each C# file you plan to reference, call verify_file_exists_tool() BEFORE drafting
       d. Only reference IDs and paths that returned ✅ VERIFIED
    2. Research existing systems using search/read tools
    3. Draft comprehensive planning document in markdown
       - ONLY use file paths and event IDs from your verification registry
       - If you need to reference something not in the registry, verify it first
    4. Use write_planning_doc_tool to save to docs/CrewAI_Plans/
    
    PLANNING DOC RULES:
    - Save to docs/CrewAI_Plans/ using write_planning_doc_tool
    - Set Status: 📋 Planning
    - Tool handles versioning automatically (updates vs new versions)
    - DO NOT update INDEX.md Feature Lookup (not implemented yet)
    - DO NOT update AI context docs (no code exists yet)
    - DO reference existing docs as Related Docs
    
    Document Structure:
    1. Title and summary
    2. Problem Statement - What problem does this solve?
    3. Current State - How do existing systems work today?
    4. Proposed Design - Technical approach with data models, methods
    5. Integration Points - Which files/systems are affected?
    6. Implementation Phases - Suggested order of work
    7. Open Questions - Unresolved design decisions
    
    VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - prevents hallucinated references):
    Before including ANY file path or event ID in the document:
    1. Use verify_file_exists_tool("src/Features/SomeFile.cs") for C# file paths
    2. Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Decisions") to verify opportunity IDs exist
    3. Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Events") to verify event IDs exist
    4. NEVER reference files like "EventEffectApplier.cs" without verification
    5. NEVER reference IDs like "opp_some_name" without verifying they exist
    6. If a file doesn't exist, find and use the correct file name
    
    JSON FOLDER PATHS (correct locations):
    - Camp opportunities: ModuleData/Enlisted/Decisions/camp_opportunities.json
    - Events: ModuleData/Enlisted/Events/
    - Order events: ModuleData/Enlisted/Orders/order_events/
    - NOT "Events/" for opportunities - that's WRONG
    
    IMPORTANT: You MUST call write_planning_doc_tool(feature_name="{feature_name}", content="...") to save the document.
  expected_output: >
    Success message from write_planning_doc_tool showing:
    - File path in docs/CrewAI_Plans/

  agent: documentation_maintainer

validate_planning_doc:
  description: >
    Validate a planning document for accuracy before finalizing.
    
    You will receive the planning document content from the previous task's output via context.
    
    VALIDATION CHECKS:
    1. File path verification:
       - Extract all C# file paths mentioned (src/Features/*.cs)
       - Use verify_file_exists_tool for EACH path
       - Flag any NOT FOUND paths
    
    2. Event ID verification:
       - Extract all event/opportunity IDs mentioned (opp_*, evt_*, etc.)
       - Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Decisions") for opp_* IDs
       - Use list_json_event_ids_tool("Events") for event IDs
       - Flag any IDs not in the returned lists
    
    3. JSON folder path verification:
       - Camp opportunities should be in Decisions/, NOT Events/
       - Order events should be in Orders/order_events/
       - Flag incorrect folder references
    
    4. Line number verification (if included):
       - Use read_csharp_tool to check if referenced line numbers are approximately correct
       - Flag if method is referenced at line X but actually at line Y (off by >20 lines)
    
    REPORT FORMAT:
    For each issue found, report:
    - ❌ [Type] Description of issue
    - Suggested fix
    
    If all verifications pass:
    - ✅ All file paths verified
    - ✅ All event IDs verified
    - ✅ All folder paths correct
    
    CRITICAL: If ANY errors are found, set status to NEEDS_CORRECTION.
    If all checks pass, set status to VALIDATED.

    Fix hallucinations and errors in a planning document.
    
    You will receive the validation report from the previous task via context.
    If the validation status is VALIDATED, simply return "No fixes needed."
    
    If the validation status is NEEDS_CORRECTION:
    1. Read the current planning doc from docs/CrewAI_Plans/{feature_name}.md
    2. For each error in the validation report:
       a. HALLUCINATED FILE PATH: Find the correct file using search_csharp_tool, then replace
       b. HALLUCINATED EVENT ID: Remove the fabricated ID or replace with a real one from list_json_event_ids_tool
       c. WRONG FOLDER PATH: Replace with correct path (Decisions/ for opp_*, Events/ for evt_*)
       d. WRONG LINE NUMBER: Update to correct line or remove line reference
    3. Save the corrected document using write_planning_doc_tool
    
    RULES:
    - Every fix MUST be verified before applying
    - If you can't find a valid replacement, mark with [TODO: needs real reference]
    - Preserve all other content exactly
    - Update "Last Updated" with correction note
  expected_output: >
    Either:
    - "No fixes needed." if validation passed
    - List of corrections made with write_planning_doc_tool success message

sync_documentation:
  description: >
    Synchronize documentation after IMPLEMENTED code changes. Only run this task
    when actual code/content has been created or modified - NOT for planning docs.
    
    Changed Files: {changed_files}
    Feature Area: {feature_area}
    
    WHEN TO RUN THIS TASK:
    - After C# code is written and builds
    - After JSON content is created and validates
    - After config files are modified
    - NOT after creating planning/design docs (use create_planning_doc instead)
    
    SYNC TASKS:
    1. Identify all docs that reference the changed code
    2. Update feature doc Status field if implementation complete
    3. Update "Last Updated" date with brief change summary
    4. Verify INDEX.md Feature Lookup entries are current
    5. Check if BLUEPRINT.md needs architecture updates
    6. Update CrewAI agent/task configs if tools changed
    7. Ensure cross-references between docs are valid
    
    AI CONTEXT SYNC (CRITICAL - stale context breaks AI assistants):
    If game systems change (tier thresholds, rep ranges, Company Needs, etc.):
    - Update docs_tools.py load_domain_context_tool
    - Update Tools/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md Balance Agent Checklist
    - Update agents.yaml backstories mentioning those values
    - Update validate_content.py if it enforces those values
    If JSON schema rules change:
    - Update Tools/Validation/validate_content.py
    - Update docs/Features/Content/event-system-schemas.md
    - Update VALIDATION_BASELINE.md if expected warnings change
    If CrewAI agents/tools change:
    - Update Tools/CrewAI/README.md
    If Warp workflow changes:
    - Update Tools/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md
    
    INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS (fix on every doc you touch):
    - Ensure standard header format: # Title, **Summary:**, **Status:**, **Last Updated:**, **Related Docs:**
    - Fix filename casing if wrong (SCREAMING-CASE.md → screaming-case.md)
    - Fix broken internal links (../Gameplay/ → ../Campaign/)
    - Move misplaced docs (ANEWFEATURE/reference.md → Reference/)
    - Remove duplicate files (prefer Reference/ or Features/ over ANEWFEATURE/)
    
    IMPORTANT: Small improvements compound. Fix issues in docs you touch.
  expected_output: >
    Documentation sync report with:
    - Docs updated (with change summary)
    - Status field changes
    - INDEX.md updates needed
    - Cross-reference fixes
    - AI context sync updates (CrewAI, Warp, domain context)
    - Incremental improvements made (renames, link fixes, header standardization)
    - Any outstanding doc debt

audit_documentation:
  description: >
    Audit documentation for accuracy against current codebase:
    
    Scope: {scope}
    
    Checks:
    1. Feature doc Status matches implementation reality
    2. Code examples in docs compile and match actual code
    3. File paths referenced in docs exist
    4. Method signatures in docs match code
    5. Configuration examples match actual config files
    6. INDEX.md entries point to existing docs
    
    Report discrepancies requiring updates.
  expected_output: >
    Documentation audit report with:
    - Stale docs needing updates
    - Broken references
    - Outdated code examples
    - Status field corrections needed
    - Priority ranking (critical/high/medium/low)
