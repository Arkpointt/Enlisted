# CrewAI Memory Storage - All tracked for cross-platform learning
#
# This folder contains the AI's learned memory and is intentionally
# tracked in Git so the AI's knowledge syncs between Windows and Linux.
#
# Memory grows over time but stays manageable (<200 MB typically).
# Contains:
# - short_term_memory/  - ChromaDB vectors (session context)
# - long_term_memory/   - ChromaDB vectors (persistent learning)
# - entities/           - ChromaDB vectors (entity relationships)
# - long_term_memory_storage.db - SQLite database
#
# All files tracked for shared AI intelligence across platforms.
# To clear memory: run ../../reset-memory.ps1
