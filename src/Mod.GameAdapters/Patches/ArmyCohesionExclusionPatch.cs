    /// Compensates for the enlisted player's negative impact on army cohesion.
    ///
    /// When enlisted, the player's party is counted as a separate party in the army,
    /// which causes cohesion penalties:
    /// - Each party in army: -1 cohesion/day
    /// - Low member parties (≤10): additional penalty
    /// - Low morale parties (≤25): additional penalty
    /// - Starving parties: additional penalty
    ///
    /// Since the enlisted player is conceptually embedded with their lord (not a separate
    /// party), these penalties are not thematically appropriate. This patch adds a
    /// compensating bonus to offset the penalties the player's party causes.
    ///
    /// Note: The player receives rations independently through the supply system, but
    /// the cohesion calculation may still see the player party as starving. We compensate
    /// for this because an embedded soldier shouldn't count as a separate starving party.
    ///
    /// Uses Postfix approach for maximum compatibility - doesn't block or modify the
    /// native calculation, just adds a compensating modifier afterward.
