    ///     Compensates for the enlisted player's negative impact on army cohesion.
    ///     When enlisted, the player's party is counted as a separate party in the army,
    ///     which causes cohesion penalties:
    ///     - Each party in army: -1 cohesion/day
    ///     - Low member parties (≤10): additional penalty
    ///     - Low morale parties (≤25): additional penalty
    ///     Since the enlisted player is conceptually embedded with their lord (not a separate
    ///     party), these penalties are not thematically appropriate. This patch adds a
    ///     compensating bonus to offset the penalties the player's party causes.
    ///     Uses Postfix approach for maximum compatibility - doesn't block or modify the
    ///     native calculation, just adds a compensating modifier afterward.
