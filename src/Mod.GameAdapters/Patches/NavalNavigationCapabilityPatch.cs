    ///     Makes enlisted players inherit naval navigation capability from their lord or army leader.

    ///     Problem: When an army travels by sea, the game checks if all member parties have
    ///     HasNavalNavigationCapability (i.e., own ships). Enlisted players typically don't own
    ///     ships - they serve on their lord's vessels. Without this patch, the player gets kicked
    ///     from the army with the menu "menu_player_kicked_out_from_army_navigation_incapability".
    ///     
    ///     Solution: Patch HasNavalNavigationCapability to return true for the player's party when:
    ///     1. Player is enlisted
    ///     2. Their lord OR the army leader has naval capability (owns ships)
    ///     
    ///     This allows the player to travel with the army by sea as they would realistically be
    ///     on the lord's ship, not sailing their own vessel.
