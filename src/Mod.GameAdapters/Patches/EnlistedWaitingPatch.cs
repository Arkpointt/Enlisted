    /// Problem: When the player's party is set to EscortParty behavior (following the lord),
    /// and the lord enters battle, MobileParty.ComputeIsWaiting() returns true because the
    /// escort target is "busy". This sets Campaign.IsMainPartyWaiting = true, which:
    /// - Prevents time from flowing even when the player tries to unpause
    /// - Causes a delay before the encounter menu appears
    /// - Results in the player joining battles late

    /// Solution: Override ComputeIsWaiting() to return false when the player is enlisted,
    /// allowing time to flow normally and encounters to process immediately.
