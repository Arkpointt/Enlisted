# Retinue System — Commander's Personal Force

The **Retinue System** provides enlisted commanders with a personal military force that grows with their rank. It represents the transition from a rank-and-file soldier to a leader of men.

## Overview

As you advance into the Commander tiers (T7-T9), you are assigned a personal squad of soldiers. These troops are embedded within your formation and look to you for leadership. Unlike the native party system, your retinue is automatically replenished and trained as you serve.

---

## Command Progression

Your retinue size scales with your enlistment tier:

| Tier | Rank Track | Soldiers | Total Force |
|------|------------|----------|-------------|
| T1-T6 | Enlisted/Officer | 0 | Companions Only |
| T7 | Commander I | 15 | 15 + Companions |
| T8 | Commander II | 25 | 25 + Companions |
| T9 | Commander III | 35 | 35 + Companions |

## Granting Recruits

When you are promoted to a Commander tier, your lord grants you a fresh batch of recruits.
- **Auto-Grant**: Troops are added automatically upon promotion; no purchase is required.
- **Formation Matching**: Recruits match your current formation specialization (e.g., if you are an infantry specialist, you receive infantry recruits).
- **Culture Integration**: Recruits are drawn from the enlisted lord's culture (e.g., Imperial Tiro, Vlandian Levies).

## Training & Development

Retinue soldiers begin as raw recruits and develop through service:
- **Combat Experience**: Soldiers gain XP naturally through participation in battles.
- **Upgrades**: Troops follow their native culture's upgrade tree.
- **Manual Training**: You can oversee drills in camp to accelerate their development, consuming **Fatigue** and **Time**.

---

## Reinforcements

The **Trickle System** ensures your retinue stays at strength despite casualties.
- **Automatic Replenishment**: One new recruit arrives every 2-3 days until you reach your tier capacity.
- **Priority Trickle**: If your retinue takes heavy losses, the replenishment rate increases.
- **Context Impact**: Low unit **Supplies** or high **Pay Tension** can slow the arrival of new recruits.

---

## Battle Integration

In battle, your companions and retinue form a **Unified Squad**.
- **Deployment**: All retinue members spawn in your designated formation.
- **Direct Command**: You have direct control over your squad using the F1-F6 command keys.
- **Reinforcements**: During battle reinforcement phases, your retinue members are automatically routed to your position.

---

## Casualty Tracking

The system meticulously tracks your retinue's health:
- **Pre-Battle Snapshot**: Your retinue state is recorded before an encounter.
- **Post-Battle Reconciliation**: Kills and wounds are calculated, and the retinue state is updated.
- **Recovery**: Wounded soldiers recover over time in your roster, aided by the unit's **Medical Care** services.
- **Losses**: Killed soldiers are removed from the retinue and must be replaced by the trickle system.
