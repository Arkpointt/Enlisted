# Provisions & Food System

The **Provisions System** allows players to manage the welfare of themselves and their unit through tiered rations, directly impacting player morale, fatigue, and retinue effectiveness.

## Overview

- **Welfare Management**: Purchasing rations is the primary way to boost morale and recovery outside of standard camp rest.
- **Officer Responsibility**: Commanders (T7+) must provision their retinues to maintain combat effectiveness and prevent desertion.
- **Quartermaster Relationship**: Buying provisions builds trust with the unit's logistician.

## Personal Rations

Players can purchase rations for themselves to gain temporary benefits. These are managed via the **Quartermaster** in camp.

### Rations Tiers

| Tier | Duration | Morale Bonus | Fatigue Recovery |
|------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Basic Rations** | 3 Days | +2 | None |
| **Good Fare** | 3 Days | +4 | -1 Fatigue/Day |
| **Officer's Table** | 3 Days | +6 | -2 Fatigue/Day |

*Note: Only one ration tier can be active at a time. Purchasing a new tier replaces the existing one.*

## Retinue Provisioning (T7-T9)

At high ranks, you are responsible for feeding your personal squad. Neglect leads to severe consequences.

### Provisioning Tiers

| Tier | Duration | Morale Effect |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Bare Minimum** | 7 Days | -5 Morale |
| **Standard** | 7 Days | Neutral |
| **Good Fare** | 7 Days | +5 Morale |
| **Officer Quality** | 7 Days | +10 Morale |

### Consequences of Neglect
- **2-Day Warning**: You will be notified when retinue provisions are low.
- **Starvation**: If provisions expire, the retinue suffers a massive morale penalty, and soldiers may begin to desert.

## Accessing Provisions

Access is handled through the **Native Game Menu** system:

1.  **Enlisted Status** (Main Menu) -> **Visit Quartermaster**.
2.  In conversation, select: **"I need better provisions."**
3.  This opens the **Provisions Submenu** where you can view current status and purchase new tiers.

## System Integration

### Fatigue & Rest
Higher-tier personal rations provide daily fatigue restoration, allowing you to perform more camp activities or complete difficult orders without becoming exhausted.

### Company Needs
While personal rations affect the player, resupplying the unit through orders or the Quartermaster impacts the **Supplies** and **Morale** company needs.

### Pay System
Provisions are purchased using your own denars. During periods of high **Pay Tension**, maintaining high morale through quality food is critical for unit stability.
