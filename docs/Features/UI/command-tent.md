## How It Works

### Service Records

Tracks military service history per faction and lifetime totals.

**Faction-Specific Records:**
- Each faction (kingdom, minor faction, mercenary) has separate records
- Tracks: terms completed, days served, highest rank, battles fought, lords served, enlistments
- Key format: `kingdom_{StringId}`, `minor_{StringId}`, `merc_{StringId}`

**Lifetime Statistics:**
- Total kills across all factions
- Total years served (cumulative)
- Total terms completed
- Total enlistments
- List of all factions served

**Display:**
- Current Posting: Shows current enlistment stats
- Faction Records: Per-faction history
- Lifetime Summary: Cross-faction totals

### Personal Retinue

At Tier 4+, players can command soldiers that fight alongside them in battle.

**Tier-Based Capacity:**
| Tier | Unit Name | Max Soldiers |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 4 | Lance | 5 |
| 5 | Squad | 10 |
| 6 | Retinue | 20 |

**Soldier Types:**
- **Infantry**: Foot soldiers with sword and shield
- **Archers**: Foot ranged (bows/crossbows)
- **Cavalry**: Mounted melee
- **Horse Archers**: Mounted ranged (not available for all factions)

**Faction Availability:**
- Horse Archers unavailable for: Vlandia, Battania, Sturgia
- Horse Archers available for: Empire, Khuzait, Aserai
- UI grays out unavailable types with tooltip

**Troop Quality:**
- Tier 4-5: Mix of Tier 2-3 troops (40%/60% distribution)
- Tier 6: Mix of Tier 3-4 troops (60%/40% distribution)
- All soldiers are of ONE chosen type (no mixing)

**Gold Costs:**
- **Purchase**: Uses native `GetTroopRecruitmentCost()` formula (~100-400 gold per soldier)
- **Daily Upkeep**: 2 gold per soldier per day
- **Desertion**: One soldier deserts per unpaid day

**Replenishment Systems:**

1. **Trickle System** (Free, Slow):
   - 1 soldier every 2-3 days (randomized)
   - Automatic, no cost
   - Respects tier capacity and party size limits
   - Waits for wounded soldiers to heal or die before filling slots (daily sync)

2. **Instant Requisition** (Costly, Fast):
   - Instant fill of all missing soldiers
   - Cost: `GetTroopRecruitmentCost() × missing soldiers`
   - 14-day cooldown between requisitions

**Party Size Safeguards:**
- Checks `PartyBase.MainParty.PartySizeLimit` before adding soldiers
- Only adds up to available party space
- UI shows party limit vs. tier capacity
- Warns when party limit restricts retinue

**Battle Integration:**
- Retinue soldiers stored in `MobileParty.MainParty.MemberRoster`
- Spawn naturally via native `PartyGroupTroopSupplier`
- Fight in same formation as player (unified squad)
- Casualties tracked by native roster system
- See [Companion Management](../Core/companion-management.md) for formation details

**Retinue Lifecycle:**
| Event | Retinue Behavior |
|-------|------------------|
| On Leave | Stays in player's invisible party |
| Player Captured | **Cleared** - soldiers scattered |
| Enlistment Ends | **Dismissed** - return to army ranks |
| Lord Dies / Army Defeated | **Lost** - scattered in chaos |
| Battle Casualties | Native tracking updates roster |

### Companion Assignments

Manage which companions fight in battles (Tier 4+).

**Settings:**
- **Fight** (default): Companion spawns in battle, faces all risks
- **Stay Back**: Companion doesn't spawn, immune to battle outcomes

**Why "Stay Back" Is Safe:**
- Native battle resolution only processes spawned agents
- "Stay back" companions survive army destruction, player capture, all battle outcomes

**Command Restrictions:**
- Companions **cannot** become formation captains or team generals during enlistment
- Prevents companions from giving tactical orders or appearing as commanders
- Applies to all companions regardless of "Fight" or "Stay Back" setting

**UI:**
- Command Tent → Companion Assignments
- Shows list of companions with toggle (⚔️ Fight / 🏕️ Stay Back)
- Changes saved immediately

See [Companion Management](../Core/companion-management.md) for full details.

## Technical Details

### System Architecture

**File Structure:**
```
src/Features/CommandTent/
├── Core/
│   ├── ServiceRecordManager.cs      # Faction record tracking
│   ├── RetinueManager.cs            # Soldier management
│   ├── RetinueLifecycleHandler.cs   # Event handling (capture, defeat, etc.)
│   └── CompanionAssignmentManager.cs # Companion participation state

```

**Design Principles:**
- Single Responsibility: Each class handles one aspect
- Event-Driven: Hooks into campaign events
- State Isolation: `RetinueState` is single source of truth
- Graceful Cleanup: `ClearRetinueTroops(reason)` handles all scenarios

### Data Storage

**Persisted Data (SyncData):**

```csharp
// Service Records
private Dictionary<string, FactionServiceRecord> _factionRecords;
private int _lifetimeKills;
private int _lifetimeTermsCompleted;
private int _lifetimeDaysServed;
private List<string> _factionsServed;

// Retinue State
private string _retinueSelectedTypeId;  // "infantry", "archers", etc.
private Dictionary<string, int> _retinueTroopCounts;  // CharacterObject.StringId → count
private int _daysSinceLastTrickle;
private CampaignTime _requisitionCooldownEnd;

// Companion Assignments
private Dictionary<string, bool> _companionBattleParticipation;  // Hero.StringId → fight/stay back
```

**RetinueState Class:**
```csharp
public class RetinueState
{
    public string SelectedTypeId { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, int> TroopCounts { get; set; }
    public int DaysSinceLastTrickle { get; set; }
    public CampaignTime RequisitionCooldownEnd { get; set; }
    public int TotalSoldiers => TroopCounts?.Values.Sum() ?? 0;
    public bool HasRetinue => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(SelectedTypeId) && TotalSoldiers > 0;
}
```

### Key APIs

**Faction Detection:**
```csharp
faction.IsMinorFaction     // Minor faction
faction.IsBanditFaction    // Bandit clan
clan.IsClanTypeMercenary   // Mercenary company
faction.IsKingdomFaction   // Major kingdom
```

**Troop Management:**
```csharp
// Add soldiers to player's party
MobileParty.MainParty.MemberRoster.AddToCounts(troopType, count);

// Check party size
int availableSpace = PartyBase.MainParty.PartySizeLimit - PartyBase.MainParty.NumberOfAllMembers;

// Get recruitment cost
Campaign.Current.Models.PartyWageModel.GetTroopRecruitmentCost(troop, Hero.MainHero);

// Deduct gold
Hero.MainHero.ChangeHeroGold(-amount);
```

**Formation Control (Battle):**
```csharp
// Team role control
Team.SetPlayerRole(isPlayerGeneral: false, isPlayerSergeant: true);

// Formation ownership
Formation.PlayerOwner = playerAgent;

// Agent formation assignment
agent.Formation = targetFormation;

// Check if agent is from player's party
var origin = agent.Origin as PartyGroupAgentOrigin;
bool isPlayerPartyTroop = origin?.Party == PartyBase.MainParty;
```

**Troop Selection:**
```csharp
// Get faction-appropriate troops by tier
CharacterHelper.GetTroopTree(baseTroop, minTier: 3f, maxTier: 4f);

// Get formation class
character.GetFormationClass();  // Returns FormationClass enum
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Service Records

**Faction Change Mid-Term:**
- Current faction record updated
- New faction record begins fresh
- Lifetime totals continue accumulating

**Minor Faction Without Kingdom:**
- Uses clan StringId as key
- Marked as "minor" type
- Full tracking still applies

### Retinue System

**Zero Soldiers After Casualties:**
- Retinue type preserved
- Player can replenish via trickle or requisition
- No need to re-select type

**Cannot Afford Purchase:**
- UI grays out unaffordable options
- Shows cost next to each option

**Party Full:**
- Retinue purchase UI grayed out
- Message: "Party is full. Dismiss troops or increase party size."
- Trickle skips silently

**Party Partially Full:**
- Purchase/requisition only fills to available space
- UI shows warning: "Party limit restricts retinue size"

**Companions Fill Party:**
- Retinue feature effectively disabled
- UI message: "Your companions fill your party. No room for retinue soldiers."

**Change Soldier Type:**
- Current soldiers must be dismissed first
- Confirmation dialog required
- Dismissed soldiers do NOT return to player

**Naval Battles:**
- Formation assignment skipped (naval DLC handles positioning)
- Cavalry/horse archers fight dismounted
- UI warning: "* Mounted troops fight on foot in naval battles."
- Native reserves system handles ship capacity overflow

### Retinue Lifecycle

**On Leave:**
- Retinue stays in player's invisible party
- No special handling needed

**Player Captured:**
- All retinue cleared from roster
- Message: "Your retinue has scattered. Your soldiers fled when you were captured."

**Enlistment Ends:**
- All retinue dismissed
- Message: "Your soldiers have returned to the army ranks."

**Army Defeated / Lord Dies:**
- All retinue lost
- Message: "In the chaos of defeat, your retinue has scattered."

**Battle Casualties:**
- Pre-battle snapshot of `_retinueState.TroopCounts`
- Post-battle: Compare roster counts to snapshot
- Native `OnTroopKilled()` updates roster automatically
- We sync tracking state to match roster

**Wounded Soldiers:**
- Wounded troops count towards retinue capacity while healing
- Daily sync catches soldiers who die from wounds between battles
- Once wounded soldiers heal or die, trickle can replenish the gap
