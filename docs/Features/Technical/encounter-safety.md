## Overview

Prevents the player from triggering map encounters while enlisted by using the game engine's `IsActive` property and Harmony patches, with enhanced battle participation and cleanup logic.

**Key Features:**
- No map encounters during peaceful service (bandit raids, etc.)
- Automatic battle participation when lord enters combat
- Player party hidden from map systems (UI and logical)
- Smooth transitions between peace and battle states
- Reliable cleanup when returning to normal campaign play
- Hides native "Abandon army" and "Leave..." menu options while enlisted (join_encounter, encounter, army_wait, raiding_village)
- Automatic cleanup of stale encounters after auto-resolve victories (prevents stuck encounter menus)

**Purpose:**
Keep enlisted players from accidentally entering encounters that would break military service or cause pathfinding crashes, while ensuring they correctly join their Lord's battles without engine conflicts.

## How It Works

### Native Menu Transition System

Before understanding the enlisted mod's encounter handling, you must understand how the native game manages menu transitions and state changes.

#### The Tick-Based Refresh System

The native game uses a **tick handler** on every menu to automatically update state every frame:

**Example:** `menu_siege_strategies` tick handler (`SiegeEventCampaignBehavior.cs:249-264`)

```csharp
private void game_menu_siege_strategies_on_tick(MenuCallbackArgs args, CampaignTime dt)
{
  // Check if this is still the correct menu to show
  string genericStateMenu = Campaign.Current.Models.EncounterGameMenuModel.GetGenericStateMenu();
  
  if (genericStateMenu != "menu_siege_strategies")
  {
    // Wrong menu! Switch to correct one
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(genericStateMenu))
      GameMenu.SwitchToMenu(genericStateMenu);
    else
      GameMenu.ExitToLast();
  }
  else
  {
    // Correct menu - refresh options based on current state
    Campaign.Current.GameMenuManager.RefreshMenuOptionConditions(args.MenuContext);
  }
}
```

**Similar tick handlers exist for:**
- `army_wait` → checks if player is still in army
- `army_wait_at_settlement` → checks if army still at settlement
- `encounter` → checks if battle still active
- ALL settlement menus → check if player still at that location

#### How Menus Decide What to Show

The game uses two key methods:

1. **`GetEncounterMenu()`** - When creating a NEW encounter (approaching enemy, arriving at siege)
2. **`GetGenericStateMenu()`** - When checking CURRENT state (every tick while menu is open)

**Example flow when approaching a siege:**

```
Frame N:   Player approaches siege camp
           EncounterManager checks GetEncounterMenu()
           Sees: mainParty.AttachedTo == null (not in army yet)
           Opens: "join_siege_event" menu
           
Frame N+1: EnlistmentBehavior.OnRealtimeTick() runs
           Joins player to lord's army: mainParty.Army = lordParty.Army
           Sets: mainParty.AttachedTo = lordParty
           
Frame N+2: menu tick handler runs
           Calls GetGenericStateMenu()
           Sees: mainParty.AttachedTo != null (in army!)
           Sees: army at siege location
           Returns: "menu_siege_strategies"
           Switches to that menu
           
Frame N+3: menu_siege_strategies tick handler runs
           Calls RefreshMenuOptionConditions()
           Updates available buttons based on:
           - mainParty.BesiegerCamp (null = not commander)
           - mainParty.Army (not null = army member)
           Shows only: "Leave Army" option
```

#### The Race Condition Timeline

| Frame | What Happens | Menu | Army State | Why |
|-------|--------------|------|------------|-----|
| N | Encounter check | - | Not in army | Native checks before tick |
| N | Opens menu | `join_siege_event` | Not in army | Based on `AttachedTo == null` |
| N+1 | Tick runs | `join_siege_event` | **Joined!** | `EnlistmentBehavior` processed |
| N+2 | Tick handler checks | Switching... | In army | `GetGenericStateMenu()` returns different menu |
| N+3 | New menu active | `menu_siege_strategies` | In army | Correct state |

**Result:** For 1-2 frames, the wrong menu flashes before auto-correcting.

#### Why This Matters for Enlisted Mod

The enlisted mod must work WITH this system, not against it:

1. **Respect tick timing** - State changes happen over multiple frames
2. **Don't fight auto-correction** - Native will switch menus automatically
3. **Use menu patches carefully** - Blocking wrong menus can break the flow
4. **Sync army joining** - If possible, join army BEFORE encounter is created

**Key files that handle this:**
- `JoinEncounterAutoSelectPatch.cs` - Handles joining battles
- `GenericStateMenuPatch.cs` - Keeps player in enlisted menus, allows native menus when appropriate
- `EncounterSuppressionPatch.cs` - Blocks unwanted encounters entirely
- `EnlistmentBehavior.cs` - State management via IsActive for siege waiting
- `EnlistedMenuBehavior.cs` - enlisted_status tick handler that yields to native menus

#### How enlisted_status Menu Integrates with Native System

The `enlisted_status` menu is a **wait menu** (like `army_wait` or `menu_siege_strategies`) that keeps the player in their enlisted state while displaying information and options. However, there are times when native menus MUST take over:

- **Sieges:** When lord's army starts besieging, `menu_siege_strategies` should appear
- **Battles:** When lord enters combat, `encounter` menu should appear
- **Settlements:** When explicitly visiting a town/castle (via "Visit Settlement" option)

**The Two-Part Integration System:**

**Part 1: GenericStateMenuPatch (Postfix on GetGenericStateMenu)**

```csharp
// File: GenericStateMenuPatch.cs
public static void Postfix(ref string __result)
{
    // Check if lord is in siege
    var lordInSiege = lordParty?.SiegeEvent != null || 
                      lordParty?.BesiegerCamp != null || 
                      lordParty?.BesiegedSettlement != null;
    
    // If at siege, allow native menu to flow through
    if (lordInSiege)
    {
        ModLogger.Debug("Menu", $"Allowing native menu '{__result}' during siege");
        return;  // Don't override - let native siege menu show
    }
    
    // Otherwise, override to enlisted_status
    if (__result == "army_wait" || __result == "army_wait_at_settlement")
    {
        __result = "enlisted_status";
    }
}
```

This patch controls WHAT menu native systems WANT to show. When at a siege, it returns early and lets native's result (`menu_siege_strategies` or `army_wait`) flow through unchanged.

**Part 2: enlisted_status Tick Handler (OnEnlistedStatusTick)**

```csharp
// File: EnlistedMenuBehavior.cs
private void OnEnlistedStatusTick(MenuCallbackArgs args, CampaignTime dt)
{
    // Check if native wants a different menu
    var desiredMenu = Campaign.Current.Models.EncounterGameMenuModel.GetGenericStateMenu();
    
    // If native wants a different menu, yield to it
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(desiredMenu) && 
        desiredMenu != "enlisted_status" && 
        desiredMenu != "enlisted_battle_wait")
    {
        ModLogger.Info("Menu", 
            $"OnEnlistedStatusTick: Native wants '{desiredMenu}' - yielding to native menu system");
        GameMenu.SwitchToMenu(desiredMenu);
        return;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, stay in enlisted_status and refresh display
    RefreshEnlistedStatusDisplay(args);
}
```

This tick handler runs **every frame** while `enlisted_status` is open. It actively checks if native wants a different menu and yields when appropriate.

**The Complete Flow When Siege Starts:**

```
Frame N:   Lord's army arrives at enemy castle
           Player in enlisted_status menu (open for hours)
           
Frame N+1: BesiegerCamp created, lord.BesiegerCamp set
           enlisted_status tick handler runs
           Calls GetGenericStateMenu()
           
           → GenericStateMenuPatch.Postfix runs
           → Detects lordInSiege = true
           → Returns early, allowing native result
           → Native returns "menu_siege_strategies"
           
           → OnEnlistedStatusTick receives "menu_siege_strategies"
           → Logs: "Native wants 'menu_siege_strategies' - yielding to native menu system"
           → Calls GameMenu.SwitchToMenu("menu_siege_strategies")
           
Frame N+2: menu_siege_strategies now active
           Shows army member options ("Leave Army")
           Player can now interact with siege
```

**Why This Design Works:**

1. **No race conditions:** Tick handlers run every frame, catching state changes immediately
2. **Native-friendly:** Mirrors exactly how native menus work (they all check GetGenericStateMenu)
3. **Two-way coordination:** Patch controls what menu is desired, tick handler acts on it
4. **Graceful transition:** Player sees smooth menu switch without flashing or loops

**What Happens When Muster Fires Mid-Siege:**

This explains why catching a muster during siege building caused the correct menu to appear:

```
Frame N:   enlisted_status open (hasn't checked GetGenericStateMenu yet this frame)
Frame N+1: Muster sequence completes
           Calls EnlistedMenuBehavior.SafeActivateEnlistedMenu()
           
           → SafeActivateEnlistedMenu checks lordInSiege
           → Detects lord.BesiegerCamp != null
           → Skips activation, logs: "Lord/army at siege - allowing native menu flow"
           → Returns early without activating enlisted_status
           
           → Native menu system takes over
           → GetGenericStateMenu() returns "menu_siege_strategies"
           → menu_siege_strategies opens
           → Correct menu appears!
```

The muster callback essentially "kicked" the menu system into re-evaluating what menu should be shown, which triggered the siege detection logic.

**Before This Fix:**

The `enlisted_status` menu would stay open indefinitely during sieges because:
- It never called `GetGenericStateMenu()` to check if native wanted a different menu
- Native's tick system only runs for the CURRENT menu - it couldn't switch away from `enlisted_status`
- Player was stuck until something (like muster) caused a menu re-evaluation

**After This Fix:**

The `enlisted_status` menu actively participates in the native tick system:
- Checks `GetGenericStateMenu()` every frame like native menus do
- Yields immediately when native wants to show siege/battle/settlement menus
- Returns to `enlisted_status` when those situations end (via the same mechanism in reverse)

### During Enlistment (Peace/Travel)

**State:** Player party is inactive and hidden

**Process:**
1. Player enlists -> `MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false`
2. Nameplate hidden via `HidePartyNamePlatePatch`
3. Game engine stops considering player for encounters
4. Player follows lord's army without map interference
5. System continuously enforces state (prevents manual changes)

**Result:**
- No bandit raids or random encounters
- No pathfinding crashes
- Player party invisible on map
- Smooth following behavior

### During Service (Battle)

**State:** Player party is active but visually hidden, participates in battle

**Process:**
1. Lord enters battle (`MapEvent` detected)
2. `EnlistmentBehavior` activates player party (`IsActive = true`) while keeping it visually hidden
3. Player party kept in same army/attachment so vanilla encounter stack automatically collects it
4. `JoinEncounterAutoSelectPatch` intercepts "join_encounter" menu and automatically joins battle on lord's side
5. Player sees standard encounter menu (Attack/Send Troops/Wait) instead of "Help X's Party / Don't get involved"
6. `AbandonArmyBlockPatch` and `EncounterLeaveSuppressionPatch` hide "Abandon army" and "Leave..." options while enlisted
7. Player participates in battle
7. If the player is a prisoner or capture cleanup is queued, battle handling is skipped to let native captivity finish (prevents crash when captors are defeated by friendlies).

**Battle Types:**

**Manual Battle:**
- Player's troops participate directly in combat
- Standard battle interface
- Player controls their squad

**Autosim (Send Troops):**
- Relies on vanilla autosim (player party isn't injected)
- After seeing report, expect encounter menu (Attack/Surrender) if army loses
- Player always resolves outcome through standard encounter UI

**Wait in Reserve:**
- Available for field battles, sally out battles, and siege preparation (not siege assaults)
- Player sits out the battle while the army fights
- `IsWaitingInReserve` flag tracks reserve state
- Player stays in `enlisted_battle_wait` menu until army finishes or player rejoins
- `GenericStateMenuPatch` intercepts `GetGenericStateMenu()` to return `enlisted_battle_wait` when in reserve, preventing native menu systems from switching to `army_wait` (which would cause visual stutter)
- Available on three menus: `encounter` (field battles), `join_siege_event` (sally outs), and `menu_siege_strategies` (siege preparation)
- Blocked only during active siege assaults (`mapEvent.IsSiegeAssault == true`) when attacking walls
- Sally out battles (defenders attacking) are treated as optional battles, not siege assaults
- Rejoin removes player from reserve, re-adds them to the MapEvent on lord's side, then activates encounter menu
- **Auto-cleanup:** If the battle has already ended (`mapEvent.HasWinner` or `mapEvent.IsFinalized`), the option won't show - instead, `TriggerPostBattleCleanup()` runs and returns player to `enlisted_status` automatically
- Handled by `EnlistedEncounterBehavior` and `GenericStateMenuPatch`

**Result:**
- Player automatically joins lord's battles
- Correct encounter menus (not "Help or Leave")
- Predictable battle behavior
- No manual intervention needed

### On Discharge / End of Service

**State:** Player party returns to normal visibility and encounter behavior

**Process:**
1. Player leaves service -> `MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = true`
2. Game engine re-enables normal encounter behavior
3. Player returns to normal world interaction
4. Nameplate restored

**Result:**
- Normal encounter behavior restored
- Player party visible on map
- Full campaign map interaction available

## Technical Details

### System Architecture

**Component Structure:**
```
EncounterGuard (Static Utility)
    ├── Initialize() - Placeholder for system init
    ├── TryLeaveEncounter() - Safely exits encounters and returns to enlisted menu
    ├── TryAttachOrEscort(lord) - Attaches player party to lord using escort AI
    ├── HidePlayerPartyVisual() - Sets IsVisible = false
    └── ShowPlayerPartyVisual() - Sets IsVisible = true

EnlistmentBehavior (Campaign Behavior)
    ├── OnTick() - Continuous state enforcement (sets IsActive directly)
    ├── Battle detection (MapEvent monitoring)
    └── Battle participation logic

HidePartyNamePlatePatch (Harmony Patch)
    └── Suppresses party nameplate UI

JoinEncounterAutoSelectPatch (Harmony Patch)
    └── Auto-joins lord's battle, bypasses choice menu
```

### State Management

**Direct State Manipulation:**

The encounter system controls party visibility and activity by setting `IsActive` and `IsVisible` directly throughout `EnlistmentBehavior`, rather than through abstraction methods. This inline approach provides fine-grained control during the many state transitions that occur during enlistment.

```csharp
// Throughout EnlistmentBehavior, state is set directly:
MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false;  // Disable encounters during service
MobileParty.MainParty.IsVisible = false; // Hide party on map

// Visibility helpers are in EncounterGuard:
EncounterGuard.HidePlayerPartyVisual();  // Sets IsVisible = false
EncounterGuard.ShowPlayerPartyVisual();  // Sets IsVisible = true
```

**Monitoring:**
- `EnlistmentBehavior.OnTick()` continuously enforces party state
- State checked every frame during military service
- Immediate response to enlistment status changes
- Prevents manual state changes by player or other systems

**State Validation:**
- System continuously resets `IsActive = false` during service
- Logs warnings if state doesn't match expected service status
- Recovers automatically on next tick

### Battle Participation

**Battle Detection:**
- Monitors `MapEvent` state for lord's party
- Detects when lord enters combat
- Activates player party for battle participation

**Auto-Join Logic:**
- `JoinEncounterAutoSelectPatch` intercepts encounter menu
- Automatically selects lord's side
- Bypasses "Help or Leave" choice menu
- Routes to standard encounter menu (Attack/Send Troops/Wait)

**Menu Routing:**
- Ensures "Encounter" menu instead of "Help or Leave"
- Standard battle interface for player
- Predictable behavior across all battle types

**Abandon Army & Leave Suppression:**
- Targeted menus: 
  - `join_encounter` (join_encounter_abandon)
  - `encounter` (abandon_army, leave)
  - `army_wait` (abandon_army)
  - `raiding_village` (abandon_army)
- Patch files: 
  - `AbandonArmyBlockPatch` (army_wait, raiding_village)
  - `EncounterAbandonArmyBlockPatch/EncounterAbandonArmyBlockPatch2` (join_encounter, encounter abandon)
  - `EncounterLeaveSuppressionPatch` (encounter leave)
- Application timing: encounter-menu patches are deferred to first campaign tick (after localization init) to avoid EncounterGameMenuBehavior static-init issues

**Siege Auto-Resolve Crash Guard:**
- Patch file: `PlayerEncounterFinishSafetyPatch` (Harmony finalizer/prefix on `PlayerEncounter.Finish`)
- Purpose: Prevents siege cleanup crashes (commonly triggered after auto-resolve) by validating encounter state and swallowing NullReferenceException while enlisted; lets other exceptions propagate

**Naval Battle Safety:**
- Sea-state sync: `ForceImmediateBattleJoin` syncs `IsCurrentlyAtSea` state and position to lord before `PlayerEncounter.Start/Init()`. Matches native requirement (`encounteredBattle.IsNavalMapEvent == MainParty.IsCurrentlyAtSea`).
- Ship assignment: `NavalBattleShipAssignmentPatch` provides five patches to prevent crashes:

  **Patch 1 - GetSuitablePlayerShip:** Intercepts before Naval DLC calls `MinBy` on empty ship collection:
  - Tier 1-6: Always board lord's ship (soldiers don't command vessels)
  - Tier 7+ with retinue AND ships: Can command own vessel (rare edge case)
  - Capacity-aware: Prefers ships that can fit player's party size, falls back to largest
  - Logs ship name, hull health, capacity, and fleet composition per battle

  **Patch 2 - GetOrderedCaptainsForPlayerTeamShips:** Assigns lord as captain when player borrows a ship (prevents null reference when looking up ship owner).

  **Patch 3 - AllocateAndDeployInitialTroopsOfPlayerTeam:** Handles cases where player team's `MissionShip` is null. Finds any friendly ship in the mission and spawns player there as crew.

  **Patch 4 - OnUnitAddedToFormationForTheFirstTime:** Prevents crash when adding AI behaviors to formations without ships. The Naval DLC creates `BehaviorNavalEngageCorrespondingEnemy` for all formations, but crashes if a formation has no ship assigned (common when enlisted player has no ships). This patch checks for a ship BEFORE creating behaviors - if no ship exists, it skips behavior creation entirely and just calls `ForceCalculateCaches()`.

  **Patch 5 - OnShipRemoved:** Safe mission cleanup when battle ends. The Naval DLC's cleanup code iterates through agents and calls `FadeOut()`, but agents in certain states (null Team, already inactive) cause a native crash. This patch intercepts `NavalTeamAgents.OnShipRemoved` and performs cleanup with null checks before each operation. Skips FadeOut for agents that are inactive or have null Team.

  **Why Patch 4 is critical:** When there are more formations than ships (e.g., player formations without ships when enlisted under a lord), the Naval DLC tries to create AI behaviors for all formations. The `BehaviorNavalEngageCorrespondingEnemy` constructor calls `GetShip()` and then immediately accesses `_formationMainShip.GameEntity` - if GetShip returns null, this crashes. We can't patch the constructor itself (returning false from a constructor prefix leaves the object uninitialized), so we patch the caller to prevent behavior creation when no ship exists.

  **Why Patch 5 is critical:** After battle ends, `OnEndMission()` removes all ships, which triggers `OnShipRemoved` for each ship. The original code assumes all agents are still valid, but during enlisted naval battles, agents may be in transitional states. The `DequeueReservedTroop` method has multiple overloads - must use `AccessTools.Method(type, "DequeueReservedTroop", new[] { navalShipAgentsType })` to avoid "Ambiguous match" exception.

  **Patch 6 - Raft State Suppression (stranded UI):** Prevents the Naval DLC `player_raft_state`/"stranded at sea" menu from firing when the enlisted player's lord (or army leader) still has ships. Deactivates the raft state and resyncs the player to the lord at sea; allows the raft menu only when the lord truly has no naval capability.

### Siege Encounters

**Overview:**
Sieges present special challenges because the native game uses multiple menus depending on the player's role (commander vs. army member) and the presence of active battles.

#### Siege Menu Types

**1. `join_siege_event`** - Initial arrival at siege location
- Shows when approaching a siege camp for the first time
- Appears when `mainParty.AttachedTo == null` (not in army yet)
- Has "Attack!" button that sets `BesiegerCamp` and makes player the commander
- **Enlisted players should NOT see this** - they should be in army already

**2. `menu_siege_strategies`** - Commander or army member at siege
- Shows based on two conditions:
  - `mainParty.BesiegerCamp != null` (player is commander), OR
  - `mainParty.AttachedTo != null && army at siege location` (player is army member)
- Options depend on role:
  - **Commander:** "Lead assault", "Send troops", "Leave"
  - **Army member:** "Leave Army" only
- **This is what enlisted players SHOULD see** at sieges

**3. `encounter`** - Active battle at siege
- Shows when `settlement.Party.MapEvent != null` (battle in progress)
- Standard battle menu: "Attack", "Send Troops", "Wait in Reserve"
- Used for sally outs and active assaults

#### The Join Siege Event Flow

**When clicking "Attack!" in `join_siege_event`:**

**File:** `EncounterGameMenuBehavior.cs:738-762`

```csharp
private void game_menu_join_siege_event_on_consequence(MenuCallbackArgs args)
{
  if (Settlement.CurrentSettlement.Party.MapEvent != null)
  {
    // Active battle exists - join it
    PlayerEncounter.JoinBattle(...);
    GameMenu.SwitchToMenu("encounter");
  }
  else
  {
    // No battle - enter siege preparation mode
    PlayerEncounter.Finish();
    MobileParty.MainParty.BesiegerCamp = settlement.SiegeEvent.BesiegerCamp;  // ← CRITICAL
    PlayerSiege.StartPlayerSiege(BattleSideEnum.Attacker, settlement);
    PlayerSiege.StartSiegePreparation();  // Opens menu_siege_strategies
  }
}
```

**The Problem Line:** `MobileParty.MainParty.BesiegerCamp = settlement.SiegeEvent.BesiegerCamp`

Once this is set:
- Player becomes the siege commander
- `GetGenericStateMenu()` ALWAYS returns `"menu_siege_strategies"` (commander view)
- Player sees commander options, not army member options
- Conflicts with enlisted role

**The Mod's Prevention:**

**File:** `EnlistmentBehavior.cs:7917-7931`

```csharp
// Do not copy BesiegerCamp onto it. Native GetGenericStateMenu() returns menu_siege_strategies
// whenever MainParty.BesiegerCamp != null, which forces commander-level siege menus.
if (mainParty != null && IsEnlisted && !_isOnLeave)
{
    if (mainParty.BesiegerCamp != null)
    {
        mainParty.BesiegerCamp = null;  // Clear it immediately
    }
    return;
}
```

Enlisted players' `BesiegerCamp` is forcibly cleared every tick. This prevents them from becoming siege commanders.

#### The Race Condition at Siege Arrival

**Timeline:**

| Frame | Event | Menu | Army State | BesiegerCamp |
|-------|-------|------|------------|--------------|
| N | Approach siege | - | Not joined | null |
| N | Encounter check | - | Not joined | null |
| N | `GetEncounterMenu()` | - | `AttachedTo == null` | null |
| N | Menu opens | `join_siege_event` | Not joined | null |
| N+1 | Player clicks "Attack!" | Processing | Not joined | null |
| N+1 | Consequence runs | - | Not joined | **SET!** |
| N+1 | `StartSiegePreparation()` | - | Not joined | SET (mod clears) |
| N+1 | Menu opens | `menu_siege_strategies` | Not joined | null (cleared) |
| N+2 | `EnlistmentBehavior` tick | `menu_siege_strategies` | **Joined!** | null |
| N+3 | Menu tick handler | `menu_siege_strategies` | In army | null |
| N+3 | `RefreshMenuOptionConditions()` | `menu_siege_strategies` | In army | null |
| N+3 | Options update | Shows "Leave Army" | ✅ Correct | ✅ Correct |

**The Issue:** 
For frames N to N+1, the wrong menu (`join_siege_event`) is visible with a non-functional "Attack!" button.

**Why "Attack!" Doesn't Work:**
1. Player clicks it
2. Sets `BesiegerCamp` (making player commander)
3. Mod immediately clears `BesiegerCamp` on next tick
4. Menu opens but player is NOT actually a commander
5. Menu shows commander options, but they fail because `BesiegerCamp == null`

#### Current Implementation (Tick-Based Yielding)

**The enlisted_status menu now participates in the native tick system:**

1. Player arrives at siege location while `enlisted_status` is open
2. Every frame, `OnEnlistedStatusTick` calls `GetGenericStateMenu()`
3. `GenericStateMenuPatch` detects `lordInSiege=true` and allows native result to flow through
4. Native returns `"menu_siege_strategies"` (army member at siege)
5. `OnEnlistedStatusTick` sees different menu desired → switches immediately
6. Player sees `menu_siege_strategies` with correct army member options

**Log Pattern:**
```
[Menu] OnEnlistedStatusTick: Native wants 'menu_siege_strategies' - yielding to native menu system
[Menu] GenericStateMenuPatch: Allowing native menu 'menu_siege_strategies' during siege
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Zero race conditions:** Tick handler catches state changes every frame
- ✅ **Native-compatible:** Mirrors exactly how native menus work
- ✅ **Smooth transitions:** No menu flashing or loops
- ✅ **Works for all scenarios:** Sieges, battles, settlements
- ✅ **Minimal code:** Simple tick check, no complex synchronization logic

**Why This Is Better Than Force-Join Approaches:**

Previous approaches tried to prevent the wrong menu from opening. The tick-based approach instead:
- Lets enlisted_status stay open most of the time (correct behavior)
- Yields immediately when native needs to take over (sieges, battles)
- Returns to enlisted_status when those situations end
- No fighting with native's encounter system
- No duplicating army-join logic with potential timing conflicts

**Integration Points:**

1. **GenericStateMenuPatch.Postfix** - Controls what menu native WANTS to show
2. **OnEnlistedStatusTick** - Acts on what native wants, switching when needed
3. **SafeActivateEnlistedMenu** - Prevents activating enlisted_status when at siege/battle
4. **TrySyncBesiegerCamp** - Correctly sets `mainParty.BesiegerCamp` for army members

**The Complete Siege Integration System:**

```
Component                    | Responsibility
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
TrySyncBesiegerCamp         | Sets mainParty.BesiegerCamp = lordCamp (for siege participation)
GenericStateMenuPatch       | When lordInSiege: allows native "menu_siege_strategies" result
OnEnlistedStatusTick        | Calls GetGenericStateMenu() every frame, switches when needed
SafeActivateEnlistedMenu    | Checks lordInSiege before activating, skips if true
menu_siege_strategies       | Native menu filters options based on role (commander vs army)
```

All components work together to ensure seamless siege integration.

### Complete Menu Flow: Siege Arrival Example

This section shows the complete interaction between all components when the player's lord starts a siege.

**Timeline: Lord's Army Arrives at Enemy Castle**

| Frame | Component | Action | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| N | EnlistmentBehavior.OnRealtimeTick | Detects lord at siege location | - |
| N | TrySyncBesiegerCamp | Checks if siege camp exists | Found: Hvalvik siege |
| N | TrySyncBesiegerCamp | Sets `mainParty.BesiegerCamp = lordCamp` | Player now in `_besiegerParties` |
| N | TrySyncBesiegerCamp | Logs integration status | ✅ InArmyParties, ✅ InBesiegerParties |
| N | Player | Currently viewing `enlisted_status` menu | Menu open for hours |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Tick handler runs (every frame) | Check state |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Calls `GetGenericStateMenu()` | Query native |
| N+1 | GenericStateMenuPatch.Postfix | Intercepts call | Evaluate state |
| N+1 | GenericStateMenuPatch | Checks `lordInSiege` | TRUE - lord.BesiegerCamp != null |
| N+1 | GenericStateMenuPatch | Returns early (allows native result) | No override |
| N+1 | Native GetGenericStateMenu | Checks `mainParty.BesiegerCamp != null` | TRUE |
| N+1 | Native GetGenericStateMenu | Returns `"menu_siege_strategies"` | Native menu desired |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Receives `"menu_siege_strategies"` | Different from current! |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Compares to current menu | enlisted_status != menu_siege_strategies |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Logs: "Native wants 'menu_siege_strategies' - yielding" | Info message |
| N+1 | OnEnlistedStatusTick | Calls `GameMenu.SwitchToMenu("menu_siege_strategies")` | Switch menu |
| N+2 | menu_siege_strategies | Menu opens, init handler runs | Setup |
| N+2 | menu_siege_strategies | Calls `RefreshMenuOptionConditions()` | Evaluate options |
| N+2 | Native siege logic | Checks if player is commander | `BesiegerCamp` != null? |
| N+2 | Native siege logic | Checks if player is army member | `Army` != null? TRUE |
| N+2 | Native siege logic | Filters options for role | Army member options |
| N+2 | Player UI | Shows "Leave Army" option only | ✅ Correct role |
| N+3+ | menu_siege_strategies tick | Runs every frame | Updates display |
| N+3+ | menu_siege_strategies tick | Calls `GetGenericStateMenu()` | Still "menu_siege_strategies"? |
| N+3+ | GenericStateMenuPatch | Still `lordInSiege=true` | Allows native result |
| N+3+ | Native | Returns "menu_siege_strategies" | Same menu |
| N+3+ | menu_siege_strategies tick | No change needed | Stay on current menu |

**What Changed vs. Before:**

**Before Fix:**
- `enlisted_status` never called `GetGenericStateMenu()`
- Menu stayed open indefinitely during sieges
- Only switched when something (like muster) caused a re-evaluation
- Player couldn't interact with siege mechanics

**After Fix:**
- `enlisted_status` checks `GetGenericStateMenu()` every frame
- Detects siege within 1-2 frames (< 100ms)
- Yields immediately to native siege menu
- Player sees correct menu and can interact with siege

**Integration Verification:**

The system includes diagnostic logging to verify siege integration is working:

```csharp
LogSiegeIntegrationStatus(mainParty, lordParty, camp, "TrySyncBesiegerCamp");
```

**Log Output:**
```
[SiegeIntegration] === Siege Integration Status (TrySyncBesiegerCamp) ===
[SiegeIntegration] Settlement: Hvalvik
[SiegeIntegration] Player Status:
[SiegeIntegration]   - InArmyParties: True (1/14 parties)
[SiegeIntegration]   - InBesiegerParties: True (1/14 parties)
[SiegeIntegration]   - AttachedToLeader: True
[SiegeIntegration]   - InMapEvent: N/A (no battle yet)
[SiegeIntegration] Integration: ✅ COMPLETE
```

This confirms the player is correctly integrated into the siege before the menu switch occurs.

### Activation Gating (Inactive Mode)

- Global gate: `EnlistedActivation` (default off). Flips on at enlist start, off at discharge; synced on load from `IsEnlisted`.
- Guard pattern: behaviors and patches early-return when inactive; logs once if something runs while inactive.
- Active while enlisted, on leave, or in desertion grace so protections stay on during grace/leave; deactivates only once all three are false.
- Crash guards: currently off while inactive per design; can be whitelisted later if needed.
- Menus: remain registered, but handlers/ticks are inert when inactive.
- Scope: finance/food/XP/formation/influence/encounter/nameplate/visibility/captain/return-to-army/order-of-battle, etc., all guarded.

---

## Edge Cases

### Player Manually Changes Party State

**Scenario:** Player or other system tries to change `IsActive` during service

**Handling:**
- System continuously resets `IsActive = false` during service
- Prevents player from accidentally re-enabling encounters
- State enforced every tick

### Game Engine State Conflicts

**Scenario:** Unexpected `IsActive` changes from game engine

**Handling:**
- Monitor for unexpected `IsActive` changes
- Log warnings if state doesn't match expected service status
- Recover automatically on next tick
- No crashes or state corruption

### Post-Victory Menu Loop (Field Battles and Sieges)

**Scenario:** After winning a battle via auto-resolve, the encounter menu reopens instead of closing

**Root Cause:** 
- After clicking "Done" on the scoreboard, the native game calls `GameMenu.ActivateGameMenu("encounter")`
- This is normal behavior for ongoing battles, but incorrect when the battle is actually over
- For enlisted players, this causes either the encounter menu or siege menu to reopen in a loop

**Handling:**
- For SIEGE battles: Native handles post-victory flow completely (menu_settlement_taken_*, etc.)
- For FIELD battles: `OnMapEventEnded` defers cleanup and returns player to enlisted menu
- Native victory menus are allowed to flow naturally
- Works for both field battles and siege battles
- Prevents "You have arrived at X to lay siege" loops after siege victories

**Related Fix - Save Load:**
- When loading a save during a siege, `MobileParty.MainParty.BesiegerCamp` is restored from the save
- This causes `GetGenericStateMenu()` to return `menu_siege_strategies` on the first campaign tick
- Fixed by clearing `BesiegerCamp` in `SyncData()` immediately during load
- Enlisted soldiers don't command sieges - only the lord does

### Stale Encounter After Auto-Resolve Victory

**Scenario:** After army wins a battle via auto-resolve, the encounter menu stays open with only "Wait in Reserve" as an option, forcing the player to click it to proceed.

**Root Cause:**
- The native game creates an encounter when the battle starts
- When the battle auto-resolves (victory), the MapEvent ends but the PlayerEncounter may persist
- The encounter menu stays open because PlayerEncounter.Current != null
- The "Wait in Reserve" option was available because it only checked for MapEvent existence, not whether the battle was already over
- Player was forced to click "Wait in Reserve" to trigger cleanup, even though there was no battle to wait for

**The Problem Code Path:**
```
1. Army engages enemy → PlayerEncounter created → encounter menu opens
2. Battle auto-resolves → MapEvent.HasWinner = true (battle over)
3. BUT PlayerEncounter still exists → encounter menu stays open
4. IsWaitInReserveAvailable() checks: mapEvent != null? YES → shows option
5. Player clicks Wait in Reserve → triggers cleanup → returns to enlisted_status
```

**The Fix (EnlistedEncounterBehavior.IsWaitInReserveAvailable):**

Added early detection for already-ended battles:
```csharp
// CRITICAL: Check if battle is already over (auto-resolved)
if (mapEvent != null && (mapEvent.HasWinner || mapEvent.IsFinalized))
{
    ModLogger.Info("EncounterGuard", 
        $"WAIT_IN_RESERVE: Battle already ended (HasWinner={mapEvent.HasWinner}, " +
        $"IsFinalized={mapEvent.IsFinalized}) - triggering auto-cleanup");
    
    // Auto-cleanup instead of showing stale option
    TriggerPostBattleCleanup();
    return false;
}
```

**The TriggerPostBattleCleanup() Method:**

**CRITICAL FIX (2026-01-03):** Cleanup is now **DEFERRED to the next frame** to prevent race condition crashes:

```csharp
private void TriggerPostBattleCleanup()
{
    // Guard against duplicate cleanup scheduling
    if (_postBattleCleanupScheduled)
    {
        return;
    }
    
    _postBattleCleanupScheduled = true;
    
    // CRITICAL: Defer to next frame to avoid modifying state during menu condition evaluation
    // The crash occurs because we're called from GetConditionsHold() during menu rendering,
    // and modifying encounter state corrupts the menu refresh loop.
    NextFrameDispatcher.RunNextFrame(() =>
    {
        _postBattleCleanupScheduled = false;
        ExecutePostBattleCleanup();
    });
}

private void ExecutePostBattleCleanup()
{
    // 1. Finish the PlayerEncounter if it exists
    if (PlayerEncounter.Current != null)
    {
        PlayerEncounter.LeaveEncounter = true;
        if (PlayerEncounter.InsideSettlement)
            PlayerEncounter.LeaveSettlement();
        PlayerEncounter.Finish();
    }
    
    // 2. Deactivate player party (prevent further stale encounters)
    if (mainParty != null && enlistment?.IsEnlisted == true)
    {
        mainParty.IsActive = false;
        mainParty.IsVisible = false;
    }
    
    // 3. Clear reserve state flag
    ClearReserveState();
    
    // 4. Return to appropriate menu
    if (mainParty?.Army != null && mainParty.Army.LeaderParty != mainParty)
        GameMenu.SwitchToMenu("army_wait");
    else
        GameMenu.SwitchToMenu("enlisted_status");
}
```

**Fixed Code Path:**
```
1. Army engages enemy → PlayerEncounter created → encounter menu opens
2. Battle auto-resolves → MapEvent.HasWinner = true (battle over)
3. IsWaitInReserveAvailable() checks: mapEvent.HasWinner? YES → schedules cleanup for next frame
4. Menu rendering completes safely → next frame → TriggerPostBattleCleanup() executes
5. ExecutePostBattleCleanup() runs → PlayerEncounter finished → party deactivated
6. Menu switches to enlisted_status automatically → player never sees stale menu
```

**Log Pattern (successful auto-cleanup):**
```
[EncounterGuard] WAIT_IN_RESERVE: Battle already ended (HasWinner=True, IsFinalized=False, WinningSide=Attacker) - triggering auto-cleanup
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Scheduling deferred cleanup for next frame (currentMenu=encounter, hasEncounter=True, mapEventId=12345678)
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Executing deferred cleanup (delay=0.016s, originalMenu=encounter, currentMenu=encounter, hasEncounter=True)
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: PlayerEncounter finished
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Deactivated party
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Switched to enlisted_status menu
```

**Why Deferring Is Critical:**

The original synchronous cleanup caused a **race condition crash** in native code:

**Crash Stack Trace:**
```
MenuHelper.CheckEnemyAttackableHonorably ← CRASH (NullReferenceException)
game_menu_encounter_attack_on_condition ← Evaluating "Attack" option
GameMenuOption.GetConditionsHold ← Checking all option conditions
GameMenuVM.Refresh ← Refreshing menu during render
MapScreen.OnActivate ← Returning from battle
```

**The Race Condition:**
1. Menu rendering begins, evaluating option conditions
2. "Wait in Reserve" condition check detects battle ended
3. `TriggerPostBattleCleanup()` called **SYNCHRONOUSLY** during condition evaluation
4. `PlayerEncounter.Finish()` modifies encounter state
5. Menu continues evaluating other options ("Attack", "Send Troops")
6. `CheckEnemyAttackableHonorably()` tries to access now-corrupted encounter state
7. **CRASH** - NullReferenceException in native code

**The Fix:**
Deferring cleanup to the next frame ensures:
- Menu condition evaluation completes with stable state
- All menu options are evaluated with consistent encounter data
- State modification happens AFTER rendering completes
- No corruption during the menu refresh loop

**Diagnostic Logging:**

Added comprehensive diagnostics to detect future race conditions:

```
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Scheduling deferred cleanup (currentMenu=X, mapEventId=Y)
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Executing deferred cleanup (delay=Xs)
[EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: MapEvent changed during defer (was=X, now=Y)
```

**What to Look For If Crash Happens Again:**

1. ✅ **Should see**: `"AUTO-CLEANUP: Scheduling deferred cleanup"` 
2. ❌ **Should NOT see**: `"Executing deferred cleanup"` with delay < 0.001s (would mean NextFrameDispatcher bug)
3. ❌ **Should NOT see**: Multiple schedules with same mapEventId within < 0.1s (race condition)
4. ❌ **Should NOT see**: OnMapEventEnded logs interleaved without time gap (simultaneous execution)

**Key Insight - Encounter Creation Path:**

This fix also revealed an important technical detail: **stale encounters after auto-resolve are NOT created through `EncounterManager.StartPartyEncounter`**. The `EncounterSuppressionPatch` (which patches `StartPartyEncounter`) never logged any `ENCOUNTER ATTEMPT` messages for these stale encounters. Instead, the encounter persists from the original battle creation and simply isn't cleaned up properly by native code.

This is why the fix is in `IsWaitInReserveAvailable()` (detection) rather than `EncounterSuppressionPatch` (prevention) - there's no new encounter being created to block.

### Consecutive Battles While in Reserve

**Scenario:** Player is waiting in reserve when army engages in another battle

**Handling:**
- `OnMapEventStarted` checks `IsWaitingInReserve` flag before processing
- If true, skips all battle processing (menu switching, teleport, army setup)
- `GenericStateMenuPatch` ensures native menu calls return `enlisted_battle_wait` instead of `army_wait`
- Player remains in `enlisted_battle_wait` menu until army finishes fighting
- Prevents duplicate XP awards and menu flickering during rapid consecutive battles
- During sieges: sally out battles won't kick player out of reserve (only actual assaults do)

### Rejoining Battle from Reserve

**Scenario:** Player clicks "Rejoin Battle" while waiting in reserve

**Handling:**
- `IsWaitingInReserve` flag cleared immediately
- Player party re-added to lord's MapEvent on same side (`playerParty.MapEventSide = lordSide`)
- Encounter menu activated via `GameMenu.ActivateGameMenu("encounter")`
- Player can then choose to Attack, Send Troops, or Leave
- If battle ended while waiting, player exits to appropriate post-battle menu

### Arriving at Siege Location Without Active Battle

**Scenario:** Enlisted player arrives at a siege location where their lord is besieging, but no battle is currently happening (just the siege camp)

**Handling:**
- Player party kept `IsActive = false` during siege waiting phase
- Native game doesn't create encounters for inactive parties
- Player INITIALLY sees `enlisted_status` menu
- **Tick system detects siege:** `OnEnlistedStatusTick` calls `GetGenericStateMenu()` every frame
- `GenericStateMenuPatch` detects `lordInSiege=true` → allows native `"menu_siege_strategies"` to return
- `OnEnlistedStatusTick` sees native wants different menu → switches immediately
- Player now sees `menu_siege_strategies` with army member options ("Leave Army")
- When assault starts, `OnMapEventStarted` detects battle → activates party → player auto-joins

**Expected Flow:**
1. Lord's army arrives at enemy castle → siege camp established
2. Enlisted player party remains `IsActive = false` 
3. Player initially sees `enlisted_status` menu (default state)
4. **Within 1-2 frames:** Tick handler detects siege → switches to `menu_siege_strategies`
5. Player can interact with siege (see progress, leave army if desired)
6. Lord initiates assault → `MapEvent` created → `IsActive = true` → player auto-joins
7. Menu switches to `encounter` (Attack/Send Troops/Wait in Reserve)

**Log Pattern:**
```
[SiegeIntegration] Synced player besieger camp with lord's siege at Hvalvik
[Menu] OnEnlistedStatusTick: Native wants 'menu_siege_strategies' - yielding to native menu system
[Menu] GenericStateMenuPatch: Allowing native menu 'menu_siege_strategies' during siege
```

**Why This Is Correct:**

Army members at sieges should see `menu_siege_strategies`, not `enlisted_status`. The native menu:
- Shows siege progress (construction, bombardment, etc.)
- Displays correct army member options
- Integrates with native siege system
- Updates in real-time as siege progresses

The mod no longer "keeps them in enlisted_status" during sieges - it yields to the native siege menu system.

### Sally Out Battle Menu Switching During Reserve

**Scenario:** Player clicks "Wait in Reserve" during a sally out battle (defenders attacking), but is immediately kicked out and sees the siege preparation menu

**Root Cause:**
- Sally out battles occur when defenders leave the castle to attack besiegers
- These battles have both `SiegeEvent` (ongoing siege) and `MapEvent` (the sally out battle)
- Original detection logic treated ANY battle during a siege as a "siege assault"
- This incorrectly forced players out of reserve during optional sally out battles

**Handling:**
- `EnlistedEncounterBehavior` tick handler now checks `mapEvent.IsSiegeAssault` specifically
- Sally out battles: `IsSiegeAssault == false` → player stays in reserve ✅
- Actual siege assaults (attacking walls): `IsSiegeAssault == true` → player forced to participate ✅
- This allows players to sit out defensive battles while still participating in wall assaults
- Log pattern when working correctly: "Siege preparation detected - staying in reserve menu"

### Lingering PlayerEncounter After Discharge

**Scenario:** Service ends (lord captured, player captured, discharge) but PlayerEncounter remains without a MapEvent

**Handling:**
- `PostDischargeProtectionPatch` blocks party activation while `PlayerEncounter.Current != null`
- This prevents crashes from "Attack or Surrender" encounters created immediately after discharge
- `SchedulePostEncounterVisibilityRestore()` queues visibility restoration
- `RestoreVisibilityAfterEncounter()` waits until PlayerEncounter clears
- **Watchdog timeout**: If encounter persists >5 seconds with no MapEvent and player is discharged (not enlisted, not prisoner), `ForceFinishLingeringEncounter()` clears it
- This prevents permanent stuck state when encounter cleanup fails

**Log Pattern:**
```
[Enlistment] Player in vulnerable state when ending service (MapEvent: False, Encounter: True, Prisoner: False) - deferring activation
[PostDischargeProtection] Prevented party activation - discharged but still in battle state (MapEvent: False, Encounter: True)
[EncounterCleanup] Force finishing lingering PlayerEncounter after discharge (requested at {time})
[Enlistment] Party visibility restored after encounter cleanup
```

### Lord Death While Enlisted

**Scenario:** Lord dies while player is enlisted

**Handling:**
- Encounter safety disabled before retirement processing
- Prevents crashes during emergency service termination
- Grace period begins normally
- State cleanup happens automatically
- Naval safety: if the player is at sea without ships when the lord dies (or any service-ending event), the system always teleports the player to the nearest port before continuing grace/retirement so they cannot get stranded on water.

### Battle Defeat (Autosim)

**Scenario:** Lord's army loses in autosim

**Handling:**
- Player sees encounter menu (Attack/Surrender) after report
- Standard native behavior
- Player resolves outcome manually
- No special handling needed

### Player Captured (Prisoner State)

**Scenario:** Player is taken prisoner after battle defeat or lord capture

**Handling:**
- Mod detects capture via `OnHeroPrisonerTaken` event
- Service ends with grace period (14 days to rejoin same kingdom after escape)
- All map event processing skipped while `Hero.MainHero.IsPrisoner == true`
- Logs show: `Skipping MapEventEnded - player prisoner or cleanup pending`
- Native captivity system takes full control of player state

**Critical - Party Activation During Captivity:**
- Native `PlayerCaptivity.StartCaptivity()` sets `MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false`
- `StopEnlist()` now checks `Hero.MainHero.IsPrisoner` before activating the party
- If prisoner, party stays deactivated; `SchedulePostEncounterVisibilityRestore()` waits for captivity to end
- `RestoreVisibilityAfterEncounter()` also checks prisoner state and defers until released
- This prevents the mod from fighting native captivity's party state management

**Important - Prisoner Transfers (Base Game Behavior):**
- While imprisoned, the base game's `TransferPrisonerBarterBehavior` remains active
- When enemy lords meet and interact (dialog/barter), they can trade prisoners
- This includes transferring the player to a different captor
- This is **expected native behavior**, not a mod bug
- The mod correctly stays inactive during captivity, letting native mechanics operate
- Grace period remains valid regardless of which enemy holds the player

**Log Pattern:**
```
[EventSafety] Lord {name} captured - starting grace period
[Battle] Encounter active during lord capture - letting native surrender capture handle the player.
[Enlistment] Service ended: Lord captured (Honorable: False)
[Enlistment] Player in vulnerable state when ending service (MapEvent: False, Encounter: False, Prisoner: True) - deferring activation
[EventSafety] Skipping MapEventEnded - player prisoner or cleanup pending (IsPrisoner=True, CaptureCleanupScheduled=False)
```

### Lord Captured While Player Active

**Scenario:** Lord is captured while player is still fighting or in encounter

**Handling:**
- `TryCapturePlayerAlongsideLord()` checks if player should be captured too
- If player already in encounter (surrender screen), native flow handles capture
- If player was in reserve, reserve state is cleared and player is teleported to safety with protection
- Grace period starts for the kingdom the player was serving
- Cleanup deferred via `SchedulePlayerCaptureCleanup()` until encounter closes

### Lord's Party Disbanded While Player in Reserve

**Scenario:** Lord's party disbands (not captured) while player is waiting in reserve during battle

**Handling:**
- `StopEnlist()` now clears `IsWaitingInReserve` immediately when service ends for ANY reason
- Harmony patches check `IsEnlisted` alongside `IsWaitingInReserve` before blocking
- If reserve flag is stale (not enlisted), patches clear it automatically
- This prevents player getting stuck with invisible/inactive party after party disband
- Player receives grace period and is restored to normal map state

**Log Pattern (when fix triggers):**
```
[Enlistment] Lord's party disbanded (Lord: {name}, Kingdom: {kingdom}) - starting grace period
[Battle] Clearing reserve state during service end
[Enlistment] Party activated and made visible (no active battle state)
```

**Log Pattern (stale flag cleared by patches):**
```
[PostDischargeProtection] Clearing stale reserve flag during activation
```

## Special Scenarios: Captivity & Village Raids

### Player Captured During Battle

**Scenario:** Enlisted player is defeated in battle and captured by enemy

**Native Game Behavior:**
1. `TakePrisonerAction.Apply()` called on player hero
2. `PlayerCaptivity.StartCaptivity()` executes:
   - Exits encounter (`PlayerEncounter.LeaveEncounter = true`)
   - Disables main party (`MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false`)
   - **Removes from army** (`MobileParty.MainParty.Army = null`)
   - Camera follows captor party
3. Player travels with captors until released

**Enlisted Mod Impact:**
- ✅ Party already hidden via encounter safety (no conflict)
- ❌ **Enlistment automatically ended** (army membership removed)
- ❌ **No tracking of pre-captivity enlistment state**
- ❌ **No auto-return to lord after release**

**Current State:**
- System works, but player loses enlistment
- After captivity ends, player is independent again
- Must manually re-enlist if desired
- No special enlisted captivity events

**Potential Improvements:**
1. **Track enlistment before capture** - Save lord and rank to mod state
2. **Post-release dialog** - Offer choice: "Return to lord?" vs "Go independent"
3. **Lord ransom attempts** - Friendly lord may pay ransom sooner
4. **Enlisted captivity events** - Special decisions/consequences during captivity

**Captivity Flow (13 menus):**
```
Captured → menu_captivity_castle_taken_prisoner
   ↓
[Multiple paths to release:]
- Wilderness escape
- Ransom offer (wilderness or prison)
- Transfer to settlement dungeon
- Prison escape
- Captor defeated/destroyed
- Ally pays ransom
- Prisoner exchange
- Escape during captor's battle
- Released after battle
- (Rare) Execution if relation < -30
   ↓
Released → EndCaptivityInternal()
   - Party reactivated (IsActive = true)
   - Camera returns to player
   - Army membership NOT restored
```

See: `docs/Reference/battle-system-complete-analysis.md` Part 6B for complete captivity flow.

### Lord Raids Village While Player Enlisted

**Scenario:** Army lord initiates village raid with enlisted player in army

**Native Game Behavior:**
1. Lord approaches village and starts raid
2. Creates `RaidEventComponent` on settlement
3. Opens `raiding_village` menu (wait menu) for all army members
4. Raid progresses via tick handler (village HP decreases)
5. On completion:
   - If player is raid leader → `village_player_raid_ended`
   - If player is army member → `village_raid_ended_leaded_by_someone_else`
6. Loot distributed via army system

**Enlisted Mod Handling:**
- ✅ Works correctly with current patches
- ✅ `AbandonArmyBlockPatch` hides "Abandon army" button on `raiding_village`
- ✅ Player participates passively as army member
- ✅ Correct post-raid menu appears
- ✅ Returns to normal army operations after

**Menu Options During Raid:**
- "End Raiding" → Hidden (not raid leader)
- "Leave Army" → Available (player can abandon mission)
- "Abandon Army" → **Blocked by enlisted mod**

**No changes needed** - Village raid system works as designed.

**Village Raid Flow (10 menus):**
```
Village Menu → "Take a hostile action"
   ↓
village_hostile_action (choose type)
   ├─ Raid village
   │  ├─ If at peace → raid_village_no_resist_warn_player
   │  └─ raiding_village (wait menu, progress bar)
   │     └─ Completes → village_player_raid_ended OR village_raid_ended_leaded_by_someone_else
   │
   ├─ Force supplies
   │  └─ force_supplies_village_resist_warn_player → force_supplies_village
   │
   └─ Force volunteers
      └─ force_troops_village_resist_warn_player → force_volunteers_village
```

See: `docs/Reference/battle-system-complete-analysis.md` Part 6C for complete raid flow.

## API Reference

### EncounterGuard Methods

```csharp
// Initialize the encounter guard system (currently a placeholder)
public static void Initialize()

// Safely leave current encounter and activate enlisted menu
// Uses NextFrameDispatcher to defer operations and prevent timing conflicts
internal static void TryLeaveEncounter()

// Attach player party to lord using escort AI for following
// Uses SetMoveEscortParty instead of AttachedTo to avoid army requirement crashes
public static void TryAttachOrEscort(Hero lord)

// Hide/show player party 3D model on map (separate from nameplate)
public static void HidePlayerPartyVisual()  // Sets IsVisible = false
public static void ShowPlayerPartyVisual()  // Sets IsVisible = true
```

### Encounter State (Direct Property Access)

```csharp
// The system controls encounters by setting these properties directly:
MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false;   // Disables encounters
MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = true;    // Enables encounters
MobileParty.MainParty.IsVisible = false;  // Hides party on map

// Check party state
bool encountersDisabled = !MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive;
bool partyHidden = !MobileParty.MainParty.IsVisible;
```

### Battle Detection

```csharp
// Check if lord is in battle
bool IsLordInBattle()
{
    var lord = EnlistmentBehavior.Instance?.CurrentLord;
    return lord?.PartyBelongedTo?.MapEvent != null;
}

// Get lord's MapEvent
MapEvent GetLordMapEvent()
{
    var lord = EnlistmentBehavior.Instance?.CurrentLord;
    return lord?.PartyBelongedTo?.MapEvent;
}
```

### Party Visibility

```csharp
// Hide party nameplate
// Handled by HidePartyNamePlatePatch
// Suppresses UI display of party nameplate

// Check party visibility state
bool IsPartyVisible()
{
    return MobileParty.MainParty.IsVisible;
}

// Check party active state
bool IsPartyActive()
{
    return MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive;
}
```

### Battle Participation

```csharp
// Activate party for battle (while keeping hidden)
void ActivateForBattle()
{
    // Set IsActive = true for battle participation
    // Keep IsVisible = false for visual hiding
    MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = true;
}

// Deactivate after battle
void DeactivateAfterBattle()
{
    // Return to inactive state during peace
    MobileParty.MainParty.IsActive = false;
}
```

```

**Common Issues:**

**Encounters still happening:**
- Check `IsActive` is actually false
- Verify `EnlistmentBehavior.OnTick()` is setting `IsActive = false`
- Check for conflicting systems changing party state
- Review logs for state validation warnings

**Not joining battles:**
- Check `MapEvent` detection logic in `EnlistmentBehavior`
- Verify battle detection is working correctly
- Check if player party is in same army as lord
- Review battle participation logs

**"Help or Leave" menu appearing:**
- Fixed by `JoinEncounterAutoSelectPatch`
- If still appearing, check patch is registered in logs
- Verify patch is applied correctly
- Check for patch conflicts with other mods

**"Attack or Surrender" after autosim defeat:**
- Expected outcome when lord loses
- Player should resolve encounter manually (Attack/Surrender)
- Matches native behavior
- Not a bug - working as designed

**enlisted_status menu stays open during siege (doesn't switch to siege menu):**
- **Cause:** `OnEnlistedStatusTick` not calling `GetGenericStateMenu()` to check for menu changes
- **Fix:** Tick handler now checks every frame and yields to native when appropriate
- **Expected log:** `OnEnlistedStatusTick: Native wants 'menu_siege_strategies' - yielding to native menu system`
- **If not switching:** Check if `GenericStateMenuPatch` is detecting `lordInSiege` correctly
- **Debug:** Enable Debug level for "Menu" category in settings.json
- **Note:** Muster callbacks can "kick" the menu system into re-evaluating, which is why catching a muster mid-siege would show the correct menu

**Siege menu appearing when it shouldn't (not at siege):**
- Check if `lordInSiege` detection is too broad in `GenericStateMenuPatch`
- Verify `lordParty.BesiegerCamp`, `SiegeEvent`, and army leader are actually at a siege
- Should only appear when lord/army is ACTIVELY besieging
- Log should show: `Allowing native menu 'menu_siege_strategies' during siege`

**Post-victory menu loop (encounter/siege menu reopening):**
- After clicking "Done" on scoreboard, the encounter or siege menu reopens
- For SIEGES: Native now handles post-victory flow completely - mod doesn't interfere
- For FIELD BATTLES: `OnMapEventEnded` defers cleanup to next frame and returns to enlisted menu
- If still happening, check if `CleanupPostEncounterState` is being called inappropriately
- For save-load loops, check if `BesiegerCamp` is being cleared in `SyncData()`

**Stale encounter after auto-resolve (stuck on encounter menu with only Wait in Reserve):**
- After army wins via auto-resolve, encounter menu stays open instead of closing
- Look for: `WAIT_IN_RESERVE: Battle already ended (HasWinner=True) - triggering auto-cleanup`
- If this log appears, auto-cleanup should handle it and switch to `enlisted_status`
- If NOT appearing, the `IsWaitInReserveAvailable` check isn't detecting the ended battle
- Check `mapEvent.HasWinner` and `mapEvent.IsFinalized` values in logs
- If auto-cleanup fails, look for: `AUTO-CLEANUP failed:` error message
- The stale encounter is NOT created through `EncounterManager.StartPartyEncounter` - it persists from the original battle

**Crash in MenuHelper.CheckEnemyAttackableHonorably (NullReferenceException):**
- Crash occurs during menu rendering after battle ends
- **Root cause:** Race condition between cleanup and menu condition evaluation
- **Stack trace pattern:**
  ```
  MenuHelper.CheckEnemyAttackableHonorably ← CRASH
  game_menu_encounter_attack_on_condition
  GameMenuOption.GetConditionsHold ← During menu refresh
  GameMenuVM.Refresh
  MapScreen.OnActivate ← Returning from battle
  ```
- **Fix:** Cleanup is now deferred to next frame via `NextFrameDispatcher.RunNextFrame()`
- **Log pattern (healthy):**
  ```
  [EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Scheduling deferred cleanup for next frame
  [EncounterGuard] AUTO-CLEANUP: Executing deferred cleanup (delay=0.016s)
  ```
- **Red flags to look for:**
  - Delay < 0.001s means NextFrameDispatcher failed to defer (framework bug)
  - Multiple schedules with same mapEventId within < 0.1s (duplicate cleanup race)
  - OnMapEventEnded logs interleaved with AUTO-CLEANUP without time gap (simultaneous execution)
- **If crash persists:** Check if `TriggerPostBattleCleanup()` is being called from a different code path synchronously

**Reserve mode menu stutter (flickering between menus):**
- `GenericStateMenuPatch` should intercept `GetGenericStateMenu()` calls
- Verify patch is registered in `conflicts.log`
- Check `IsWaitingInReserve` is true when in reserve
- If stutter persists, the patch may be missing from `Enlisted.csproj`

**Rejoin battle not working:**
- Log should show: "Player rejoining battle from reserve"
- Player must be re-added to MapEvent before encounter menu activates
- Check `lordParty.Party.MapEventSide` is not null
- Verify `GameMenu.ActivateGameMenu("encounter")` is called

**Wait in Reserve kicks player out during sally out battles:**
- Sally out battles are when defenders leave the castle to attack besiegers
- These should be treated as optional field battles, not siege assaults
- Check log for: "Siege assault started - cleared reserve state"
- If appearing during sally out, the detection logic is too broad
- Fix: Only exit reserve when `mapEvent.IsSiegeAssault == true` (actual wall assault)
- Sally outs have `MapEvent` but `IsSiegeAssault == false`

**Party state not persisting:**
- Check state enforcement in `OnTick()`
- Verify state is being reset continuously
- Check for save/load issues
- Review state validation logs

**Repeated "Skipping MapEventEnded" logs while prisoner:**
- This is **expected behavior** when `IsPrisoner=True`
- The mod correctly skips all map event processing during captivity
- Native captivity system handles all prisoner mechanics
- Grace period remains active for rejoining after escape
- Log pattern: `Skipping MapEventEnded - player prisoner or cleanup pending (IsPrisoner=True, CaptureCleanupScheduled=False)`

**Player transferred to different captor:**
- This is **base game behavior**, not a mod bug
- Native `TransferPrisonerBarterBehavior` allows lords to trade prisoners
- When enemy lords meet/dialog, they can exchange prisoners including the player
- The mod correctly stays inactive during captivity
- Grace period is unaffected by captor changes

**Party stuck invisible/inactive after discharge:**
- Check if PlayerEncounter is lingering: log shows `Prevented party activation - discharged but still in battle state (Encounter: True)`
- Watchdog should force-finish after 5 seconds: `Force finishing lingering PlayerEncounter after discharge`
- If still stuck, check if player is prisoner (`IsPrisoner=True`) - native captivity owns state until release
- Log pattern when prisoner blocks activation: `Player in vulnerable state when ending service (Prisoner: True) - deferring activation`
- If stuck after party disband while in reserve, check log for `Clearing reserve state during service end` - this should clear the flag
- If patches see stale reserve flag, they auto-clear it: `Clearing stale reserve flag during activation`

**Crash in PlayerEncounter.Finish() after siege battle (NullReferenceException):**
- This was caused by a race condition between our mod and native AI
- After siege battles, native `AiPartyThinkBehavior.PartyHourlyAiTick` calls `PlayerEncounter.Finish()` when parties change behavior
- If our deferred cleanup ran at the same time, internal state became inconsistent
- Fixed by: (1) finishing siege encounters immediately instead of deferring, (2) `PlayerEncounterFinishSafetyPatch` catches and recovers from crashes
- Log pattern on crash recovery: `Recovering from NullReferenceException in Finish - cleaning up encounter state`
- Log pattern showing siege immediate cleanup: `Siege battle ended - finishing encounter immediately to avoid native AI race`
- Debug context shows caller: `NativeAI` = native system, `EnlistmentBattle` = our OnMapEventEnded
- Rapid call detection: `Rapid Finish calls detected: Xms apart` indicates race condition was occurring

**"Party activated and made visible" but player is prisoner:**
- This was a bug (now fixed) - StopEnlist didn't check prisoner state before activating
- Current code checks `playerIsPrisoner` alongside MapEvent/Encounter before deciding to activate
- If you see this log while prisoner, ensure you have the latest code

**Naval Battle Crash Debugging:**

If you see crashes in naval battles with stack traces containing:
- `NavalDLC.GameComponents.NavalDLCShipDeploymentModel.GetSuitablePlayerShip` -> Patch 1 should handle this
- `NavalDLC.GameComponents.NavalDLCShipDeploymentModel.GetOrderedCaptainsForPlayerTeamShips` -> Patch 2 should handle this
- `NavalDLC.Missions.MissionLogics.NavalAgentsLogic.AddReservedTroopToShip` -> Patch 3 should handle this
- `NavalDLC.Missions.AI.Behaviors.BehaviorNavalEngageCorrespondingEnemy..ctor` -> Patch 4 should handle this
- `NavalDLC.Missions.MissionLogics.NavalTeamAgents.OnShipRemoved` -> Patch 5 should handle this
- `TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.BattleObserverMissionLogic.OnAgentRemoved` (during naval cleanup) -> Patch 5 handles indirectly

Log messages to look for:
```
[Naval] Naval enlisted crew fix registered (GetSuitablePlayerShip)
[Naval] Naval captain assignment fix registered
[Naval] Naval troop allocation fix registered
[Naval] Naval TeamAI formation patch registered
[Naval] Naval OnShipRemoved safety fix registered
```

If formation crash persists:
- Enable Debug level for "Naval" category in `settings.json`
- Check if `Skipping naval behaviors for Formation X - no ship assigned` appears
- If not appearing, the patch isn't detecting the shipless formation
- Check `GetShip` reflection is working (look for method lookup errors)

If mission cleanup crash persists (crash after battle ends):
- Look for `OnShipRemoved: Handling cleanup` in logs
- Check if cleanup completes: `OnShipRemoved: Cleanup complete`
- Common cause: agent with null Team being passed to FadeOut
- If falling back to original: "OnShipRemoved error" will show the exception

**Key Technical Details:**

*Constructor prefix limitation:* You CANNOT prevent object creation by returning `false` from a Harmony prefix on a constructor - the object is already allocated, only the constructor body is skipped. This leaves the object uninitialized and it will crash when used. Always patch the CALLER instead.

*Method overload ambiguity:* When using `AccessTools.Method` for Naval DLC internals, always specify parameter types. `DequeueReservedTroop` has 2 overloads - use `AccessTools.Method(type, "DequeueReservedTroop", new[] { navalShipAgentsType })` to avoid "Ambiguous match" exceptions that silently break patches.
