# Part 1: Runtime Conflict Detection

## ModConflictDiagnostics Overview

**File:** `src/Mod.Core/Logging/ModConflictDiagnostics.cs` (828 lines)

**Purpose:** Automatically detects when other mods patch the same game methods as Enlisted, helping diagnose incompatibilities.

**When It Runs:**
- **Phase 1:** Automatically on game startup (`OnSubModuleLoad`)
- **Phase 2:** When campaign starts (deferred patches applied on first tick)

**Output Location:**
```
<BannerlordInstall>\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\Conflicts-A_2025-12-23_14-30-15.log
```

**Log Rotation:** Keeps last 3 conflict logs (Conflicts-A, Conflicts-B, Conflicts-C)

**Performance:** Lightweight - only runs at startup, no per-frame overhead

---

## How It Works

### What It Detects

**ModConflictDiagnostics** performs comprehensive diagnostics:

1. **Harmony Patch Conflicts:** Uses Harmony's patch introspection to find methods that multiple mods patch
2. **Module Health Check:** Verifies presence of critical JSON/XML files for all content types (Dialogue, Events, Decisions, Orders, Config, Localization)
3. **Runtime Catalog Status:** Confirms successful loading and parsing of content catalogs via reflection
4. **Patch Application Status:** Reports total methods patched and breakdown by patch type (prefix, postfix, transpiler, finalizer)
5. **Installation Path Detection:** Logs game root, mod DLL path, and module path to help diagnose Steam Workshop vs manual installs

**Harmony Patch Conflict Detection:**

```csharp
// For each method Enlisted patches
foreach (var method in harmony.GetPatchedMethods())
{
    var patchInfo = Harmony.GetPatchInfo(method);
    
    // Check if other mods also patch this method
    var otherMods = patchInfo.Prefixes
        .Concat(patchInfo.Postfixes)
        .Concat(patchInfo.Transpilers)
        .Select(p => p.owner)
        .Where(owner => owner != "com.enlisted.mod")
        .ToList();
    
    if (otherMods.Any())
    {
        // Log potential conflict
    }
}
```

### Two-Phase Detection

**Phase 1: Main Patches (Startup)**
- Applied during `OnSubModuleLoad`
- Most patches (encounter safety, UI, menus, etc.)
- Logged immediately

**Phase 2: Deferred Patches (Campaign Start)**
- Applied on first `Campaign.Tick()`
- Encounter menu patches, abandon army blocks
- Prevents Linux/Proton crashes from early patching
- Appended to same log file

**Why Two Phases?**
Some patches require game systems to initialize first. Patching too early causes `TypeInitializationException` on Proton/Linux.

## Reading Conflict Logs

### Log Structure

```
========================================================================
              ENLISTED MOD - CONFLICT DIAGNOSTICS
========================================================================
Generated: 2025-12-23 14:30:15

-- ENVIRONMENT --
  Game Version:       1.3.13.xxxxx
  Enlisted Version:   v0.9.0
  Target Game:        1.3.13
  CLR Version:        4.0.30319.42000
  OS:                 Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26200.0
  64-bit Process:     True

-- LOADED MODULES --
  Total: 15 modules
   1. SandBoxCore.ModuleData
   2. StoryMode.ModuleData
   3. Enlisted.Mod.Entry.SubModule <-- THIS MOD
   ... (other mods)

-- HARMONY PATCH CONFLICT ANALYSIS (MAIN PATCHES) --
  Enlisted patches (main patches): 45 methods

  [OK] NO CONFLICTS DETECTED
  
  All Enlisted patches are exclusive - no other mods are patching
  the same game methods. If you're having issues, the problem is
  likely not a mod conflict.

-- ENLISTED PATCH LIST (Main) --
  Total: 45 methods patched

  [Army/Party] (8)
    - MobileParty.SetMoveEscortParty
    - MobileParty.Tick
    ... (more)

  [Encounter] (12)
    - PlayerEncounter.Init
    - PlayerEncounter.Finish
    ... (more)

-- DEFERRED PATCHES (Applied on Campaign Start) --
  [Same format as main patches]

-- COMBINED CONFLICT SUMMARY --
  Total Enlisted patches: 53 methods
  Other mods sharing patches: 2

  Mods with shared patches (potential conflict sources):
    - some.other.mod
    - another.mod.id
```

### Conflict Example

```
-- HARMONY PATCH CONFLICT ANALYSIS (MAIN PATCHES) --
  [!] POTENTIAL CONFLICTS: 3

  Mod: some.economy.overhaul
    Shared patches: 2
      - Hero.ChangeHeroGold
      - Clan.AddRenown

  -- Patch Execution Order --
  Hero.ChangeHeroGold:
    Postfixes (run after original, lowest priority first):
      [800] com.enlisted.mod <- Enlisted
      [400] some.economy.overhaul
```

**What This Means:**
- Both Enlisted and the economy mod patch `Hero.ChangeHeroGold`
- Enlisted's postfix runs AFTER the other mod's (higher priority number)
- **Not necessarily a problem** - patches can coexist if they don't contradict
- **Possible issue** - if the other mod expects its changes to be final

### Categories

Patches are auto-categorized by type name:

| Category | Example Types | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Army/Party | `MobileParty`, `Army` | Party movement, escort, visibility |
| Encounter | `PlayerEncounter`, `MapEvent` | Battle/encounter state |
| Finance | `Clan`, `Hero`, `ChangeGold` | Gold/income modifications |
| UI/Menu | `GameMenu`, `Screen`, `Message` | Interface and menus |
| Combat | `Mission`, `Battle`, `Agent` | Combat mechanics |
| Kingdom/Clan | `Kingdom`, `Relation` | Diplomacy and faction |

---

## When to Share Logs

**Include `Conflicts-A_*.log` when reporting:**

✅ **Definite conflict issues:**
- Mod works alone but breaks with specific other mods
- UI elements don't appear
- Gold/equipment changes don't apply
- Encounter/battle state broken

✅ **General troubleshooting:**
- Crashes on startup
- Errors in game logs mentioning Enlisted
- Save game compatibility issues

✅ **Support requests:**
- Bug reports on Nexus/GitHub
- Help requests in Discord
- Compatibility questions

❌ **Not needed for:**
- Feature requests
- Content suggestions
- Documentation issues

**Where to find it:**
```
<Steam>\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\
```

### Summary: ModConflictDiagnostics

**What it IS:**
- ✅ Automatic runtime detection of Harmony patch conflicts
- ✅ Categorized list of all patches Enlisted applies
- ✅ Helps diagnose mod incompatibilities
- ✅ Useful for support/bug reports

**What it is NOT:**
- ❌ Does not detect content errors (malformed events, invalid JSON)
- ❌ Does not detect logic bugs (wrong calculations, broken features)
- ❌ Does not detect performance issues
- ❌ Does not need updates when we add features

**Does it need updates for new features (retinue, baggage train, etc.)?**
**NO** - The system automatically detects and categorizes new patches. It uses Bannerlord class name patterns for categorization, so new features are handled automatically.

**Code Location:** `src/Mod.Core/Logging/ModConflictDiagnostics.cs` (828 lines, well-commented)

---

# Part 2: Development Guidelines

**Note:** The sections below are for internal development use. They document how our systems interact and provide guidelines for avoiding conflicts when adding new features.

---

## Recent Architectural Changes (2026-01-03)

### Orchestrator Opportunity Unification

**Problem Solved:** Opportunities would disappear from the Camp Hub when the lord left a settlement mid-session, creating a jarring UX where content the player was about to interact with vanished.

**Root Cause:** Menu was regenerating opportunities on-demand based on current context, rather than using a locked schedule.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **ContentOrchestrator** now owns the opportunity lifecycle
- Opportunities pre-scheduled at 6am daily tick for all 4 phases (Dawn/Midday/Dusk/Night)
- Schedule **locked** for 24 hours once generated
- Menu queries `ContentOrchestrator.GetCurrentPhaseOpportunities()` (no cache, no regeneration)
- **CampOpportunityGenerator** role changed to candidate provider only
- Narrative hints generated from locked schedule for Daily Brief

**Impact on Development:**
- ✅ Opportunities persist when context changes (lord leaves, phase changes)
- ✅ Menu has no cache - single source of truth in Orchestrator
- ✅ Player can see hints about upcoming opportunities
- ✅ Quiet phases are intentional and communicated via hints
- ⚠️ **Breaking Change:** `CampOpportunityGenerator.GenerateCampLife()` now internal, only Orchestrator calls it
- ⚠️ **Deprecated:** `DecisionManager.GetAvailableOpportunities()` replaced by Orchestrator queries

**Related Documentation:** [Orchestrator Opportunity Unification Spec](../../ORCHESTRATOR-OPPORTUNITY-UNIFICATION.md)

### Bug Fixes Applied

**2026-01-03:**
- Decision tree now persists when lord leaves castle (uses locked schedule instead of regenerating)
- Decisions correctly disappear after selection (added fallback consumption by decision ID)

**2026-01-04:**
- Decisions no longer fire as popups (MapIncidentManager filters "decision" and "onboarding" categories)
- Deprecation warnings eliminated (GetUpcomingHints and GetCampActivityFlavor now use Orchestrator)

### New Systems Added

| System | Purpose | Integration Points |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **ContentOrchestrator** | Pre-schedules opportunities, provides world state analysis | Daily tick, menu queries, narrative hints |
| **CampOpportunityGenerator** | Generates opportunity candidates (no longer owns state) | Called by Orchestrator only |
| **WorldStateAnalyzer** | Analyzes lord situation, war stance, activity level | Used by Orchestrator, EventPacingManager, OrderProgressionBehavior |
| **BaggageTrainAvailability** | World-state-aware baggage access simulation | Integrated with Quartermaster, Orchestrator provides context |
| **RetinueManager** | Commander's retinue management (T7+) | Pay system, formation assignment, baggage access |
| **CompanySimulationBehavior** | Background camp life simulation | Daily tick, news feed integration |

**For Full System Analysis:** See [Systems Integration Analysis](../../ANEWFEATURE/systems-integration-analysis.md) for comprehensive analysis of all tracking systems (Supply, Morale, Reputation, Escalation) and how they integrate with ContentOrchestrator.

---

## System Integration Points

**Purpose:** Documents where our systems interact and potential conflict points during development.

**Development Note:** This section documents integration between our systems (retinue, baggage, quartermaster, etc.) to help developers avoid conflicts when adding features.

### System Integration Matrix

### EventSelector (Content Eligibility)

**File:** `src/Features/Content/EventSelector.cs`

**What It Does:**
- Filters events by one-time flags (skip if already fired)
- Checks cooldowns (skip if recently fired)
- Validates requirements via `EventRequirementChecker`
- Validates trigger conditions (flags, contexts, escalation)

**When It Runs:**
- Every time `EventPacingManager` wants to deliver an event
- Every time player opens Camp Hub (for decisions)

**Filtering Logic:**
```csharp
foreach (var evt in allEvents)
{
    // Skip decision events in automatic pacing
    if (evt.Category == "decision") continue;
    
    // Skip one-time events that already fired
    if (evt.Timing.OneTime && HasFired(evt.Id)) continue;
    
    // Skip events on cooldown
    if (IsOnCooldown(evt.Id, evt.Timing.CooldownDays)) continue;
    
    // Check requirements (tier, role, context, skills, etc.)
    if (!EventRequirementChecker.MeetsRequirements(evt.Requirements)) continue;
    
    // Check trigger conditions (flags, contexts, escalation)
    if (!CheckTriggerConditions(evt)) continue;
    
    candidates.Add(evt);
}
```

**What To Do:**
- Ensure events have specific enough requirements to avoid spam
- Use trigger conditions to make events mutually exclusive
- Set appropriate cooldowns (typically 7-30 days)

### EventRequirementChecker (Eligibility Validation)

**File:** `src/Features/Content/EventRequirementChecker.cs`

**What It Does:**
- Validates tier ranges (MinTier, MaxTier)
- Validates role requirements (Scout, Officer, etc.)
- Validates context (War, Peace, Siege, Battle, Town)
- Validates skill minimums
- Validates trait minimums
- Validates escalation thresholds
- Validates onboarding stage/track
- Validates HP requirements

**When It Runs:**
- Called by `EventSelector` during candidate filtering
- Called by `CampOpportunityGenerator` during candidate generation (for Orchestrator)
- **DEPRECATED:** Previously called by `DecisionManager` - now Orchestrator provides pre-filtered opportunities

**What To Do:**
- Use specific requirements to prevent overlapping events
- Avoid impossible combinations (e.g., MinTier=1, Role=Officer)
- Document requirement logic in event JSON comments
- **NEW:** Requirements checked once at daily scheduling time (6am), then locked for 24h

### Centralized State Managers

**Files:**
- `src/Features/Escalation/EscalationManager.cs` - Reputation and escalation
- `src/Features/Company/CompanyNeedsManager.cs` - Readiness, Morale, Supply
- `src/Features/Camp/FatigueManager.cs` - Rest and fatigue

**What They Do:**
- Enforce valid ranges (clamp to 0-100, -50 to +50, etc.)
- Log all state changes with category
- Prevent direct field modification
- Provide consistent API for all systems

**Pattern:**
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Direct modification
playerState.LordReputation += 10;

// ✅ CORRECT: Use manager
EscalationManager.ChangeLordRep(10, "Event: Successful patrol");
```

**What To Do:**
- Always use managers for state changes
- Include descriptive reason strings in logs
- Check manager logs when debugging state issues

### Encounter Safety Checks

**Files:** `src/Features/Enlistment/Behaviors/EnlistmentBehavior.cs`, various patches

**What They Do:**
- Prevent menu activation during battles
- Block party state changes during encounters
- Detect siege-related battle types
- Handle edge cases (lord captured, player prisoner, etc.)

**Checks:**
```csharp
// Block menus during critical states
if (MobileParty.MainParty.MapEvent != null) return false;
if (PlayerEncounter.Current != null) return false;
if (Hero.MainHero.IsPrisoner) return false;
```

**What To Do:**
- Never assume player is in peaceful state
- Check for active battles before opening menus
- Defer state changes during encounters
- See [Encounter Safety](encounter-safety.md) for full guide

### Content Validation Tool

**File:** `tools/events/validate_content.py` (enhanced validator)

**What It Does:**
- **Phase 1:** Structure validation (JSON schema, required fields, enum values)
- **Phase 2:** Reference validation (localization strings, skills, traits)
- **Phase 3:** Logical validation (impossible combinations, reasonable values)
- **Phase 4:** Consistency checks (flags, multi-stage events, priorities)

**Features:**
- Checks for duplicate event IDs across all files
- Validates option counts (2-4 range)
- Validates localization references against `enlisted_strings.xml`
- Detects impossible tier × role combinations
- Validates skill/trait names
- Checks cooldown reasonableness
- Tracks flag usage consistency
- Validates escalation thresholds
- **NEW (2026-01-03):** Validates opportunity hints (`hint`/`hintId` fields for narrative foreshadowing)

**What To Do:**
- Run before committing content changes: `python tools/events/validate_content.py`
- Use `--strict` mode for pre-merge validation: `python tools/events/validate_content.py --strict`
- See `tools/events/README.md` for complete usage guide
- **NEW:** Add `hint` or `hintId` to camp opportunities for Daily Brief integration (see [Event System Schemas](../Content/event-system-schemas.md#narrative-hints-orchestrator-pre-scheduling))

**Legacy Tool:** `tools/events/validate_events.py` (basic ID/option count checks, use enhanced tool instead)

## System Integration Points

This matrix shows where systems interact and potential conflict points.

### ContentOrchestrator × Content Systems

**MAJOR CHANGE (2026-01-03):** The ContentOrchestrator now **owns the opportunity lifecycle**. Opportunities are pre-scheduled 24 hours ahead, locked once generated, and provided via `GetCurrentPhaseOpportunities()`. This prevents jarring content disappearance when context changes mid-day.

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| ContentOrchestrator | Opportunity scheduling | Opportunities disappear when lord leaves castle | **FIXED:** Pre-schedule at 6am daily tick, lock schedule for 24h |
| ContentOrchestrator | Camp decisions menu | Stale opportunities shown | Menu queries Orchestrator directly, no cache |
| ContentOrchestrator | Daily Brief hints | Hints mismatch visible opportunities | Hints generated from same locked schedule |
| CampOpportunityGenerator | Candidate generation | Generator owns state vs Orchestrator owns state | **FIXED:** Generator is now candidate provider only |
| EventDeliveryManager | Decision/Event separation | Decisions firing as popups | Decisions filtered from automatic event selection |
| MapIncidentManager | Decision/Event separation | Decisions appearing in map incidents | **FIXED:** Filter "decision" and "onboarding" categories |

**Key Rule:** ContentOrchestrator owns all opportunity state. CampOpportunityGenerator only generates candidates on request.

**Related Documentation:** [Orchestrator Opportunity Unification Spec](../../ORCHESTRATOR-OPPORTUNITY-UNIFICATION.md)

### Enlistment × Equipment

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Enlistment | Quartermaster access | Player could access QM after discharge | QM checks `IsEnlisted` before opening |
| Enlistment | Baggage train access | Player could access baggage after discharge | Baggage checks `IsEnlisted` |
| Enlistment | Provisions shop | Shop open during invalid states | Shop checks `IsEnlisted` AND `CanAccessBaggage()` |
| Discharge | Equipment cleanup | Player keeps issued gear | System tracks issued items, reclaims on discharge |

**Key Rule:** All equipment systems must check enlistment status before allowing access.

### Retinue × Company Systems

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Retinue | Company Supply | Retinue affects supply needs | Supply calculation includes retinue size modifier |
| Retinue | Pay System | Retinue costs gold | Pay deduction includes retinue wages |
| Retinue | Baggage Train | Retinue requires baggage access | Retinue trickle blocked when baggage unavailable |
| Retinue | Formation Assignment | Retinue in player formation | Formation logic accounts for retinue units |

**Key Rule:** Retinue features only active for T7+ and check commander status.

### Quartermaster × Baggage Train

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| QM Equipment | Baggage availability | Sell/upgrade when baggage unavailable | QM checks `CanAccessBaggage()` for sells/upgrades |
| QM Provisions | Baggage availability | Buy food when baggage unavailable | Provisions requires `CanAccessBaggage()` |
| QM Dialogue | March state | QM mentions baggage but it's unavailable | Context-aware dialogue variants |
| QM Inventory | Muster refresh | Inventory refreshes during baggage-unavailable periods | Refresh only happens at valid baggage access times |

**Key Rule:** Quartermaster systems respect baggage train availability gates.

**World-State Integration (NEW 2026-01-03):** `ContentOrchestrator.RefreshBaggageSimulation()` provides world situation to `BaggageTrainManager` for dynamic probability calculation. Activity level, lord situation, war stance, and terrain all affect baggage catch-up/delay/raid chances.

**Related Documentation:** [Baggage Train Availability](../Equipment/baggage-train-availability.md)

### Events × State Systems

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Events | Reputation changes | Multiple events modifying same track | Use `EscalationManager` for all changes |
| Events | Company Needs | Events affecting Readiness/Morale/Supply | Use `CompanyNeedsManager` for all changes |
| Events | Fatigue | Events awarding rest or adding fatigue | Use `FatigueManager` for all changes |
| Events | Gold | Events giving/taking gold | Use `GiveGoldAction` for all gold changes |
| Events | Equipment | Events giving/removing items | Use party `ItemRoster` methods with logging |

**Key Rule:** Events never modify state directly—always use managers and actions.

### Camp Hub × Automatic Events

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Decisions | Event pacing | Player decision blocks automatic event | Decisions have priority (player-initiated) |
| Decisions | Cooldowns | Same content as decision and event | Use separate IDs, shared cooldown if needed |
| Camp Hub | Event popups | Menu closes when event fires | Events defer until player closes menu |
| Decisions | Requirements | Decision available but event can't fire | Decisions have lower requirements (more accessible) |

**Key Rule:** Player-initiated decisions take priority over automatic events. Event popups wait for menu closure.

**Orchestrator Integration (NEW 2026-01-03):** ContentOrchestrator pre-schedules opportunities at daily tick (6am), locks them for 24 hours, and provides them via `GetCurrentPhaseOpportunities()`. Menu queries Orchestrator directly with no cache. Consumed opportunities are marked and removed from display. This prevents opportunities from disappearing when context changes (e.g., lord leaves castle).

**Bug Fixes Applied:**
- 2026-01-03: Decision tree now persists when lord leaves castle (uses locked schedule)
- 2026-01-03: Decisions correctly disappear after selection (improved consumption)
- 2026-01-04: Decisions no longer fire as popups (filtered from MapIncidentManager)

**Related Documentation:** [Orchestrator Opportunity Unification](../../ORCHESTRATOR-OPPORTUNITY-UNIFICATION.md)

### Orders × Other Systems

| System | Integration Point | Conflict Risk | Resolution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Orders | Company Needs | Order completion affects needs | Use `CompanyNeedsManager` in completion handlers |
| Orders | Reputation | Order success/failure affects rep | Use `EscalationManager` in completion handlers |
| Orders | Events | Event fires during active order | Events can reference active order in triggers |
| Orders | Map Incidents | Incident fires during order | Incidents can check `ActiveOrderId` flag |

**Key Rule:** Orders are the primary gameplay driver—other systems should reference order state when relevant.

### Daily Tick Systems (Order Matters)

These systems all run on `Campaign.Tick()` - order matters:

1. **EnlistmentBehavior.OnTick()** - Updates enlistment state, detects battles, handles encounter safety
2. **ContentOrchestrator.OnDailyTick()** - **NEW (2026-01-03):** Pre-schedules opportunities for next 24 hours, locks schedule, generates narrative hints
3. **OrdersManager.OnDailyTick()** - Checks order progress, handles expiration
4. **CompanyNeedsManager.OnDailyTick()** - Updates Readiness/Morale/Supply decay
5. **FatigueManager.OnDailyTick()** - Updates fatigue from marching
6. **PayManager.OnWeeklyTick()** - Processes wage payments (weekly, not daily)
7. **RetinueManager.OnDailyTick()** - Processes retinue trickle, loyalty changes
8. **EventPacingManager.OnDailyTick()** - Considers delivering automatic events
9. **CompanySimulationBehavior.OnDailyTick()** - **NEW:** Background camp simulation, incidents

**Why Order Matters:**
- Enlistment check must run first (other systems check `IsEnlisted`)
- **Orchestrator schedules early** (provides world state to other systems)
- Order progress before events (events can reference order state)
- Company needs before events (events check need thresholds)
- Pay before retinue (retinue costs deducted from wages)
- **Orchestrator provides context** to baggage simulation, event pacing, order event frequency

---

## State Modification Priorities

When multiple systems want to modify the same state, these rules determine priority.

### Reputation & Escalation

**Managed By:** `EscalationManager`

**Tracks:**
- Lord Reputation (0-100)
- Officer Reputation (0-100)
- Soldier Reputation (-50 to +50)
- Scrutiny (0-10)
- Discipline (0-10)
- Medical Risk (0-5)
- Pay Tension (0-100)

**Priority Order (highest to lowest):**

1. **Direct Player Actions** (Camp Hub decisions, dialogue choices)
   - Immediate feedback to player choice
   - Example: "Request Audience" decision modifies Lord Rep

2. **Order Completion/Failure**
   - Core gameplay loop must have clear consequences
   - Example: Failed patrol order decreases Officer Rep

3. **Automatic Events**
   - Fire based on thresholds and context
   - Example: Escalation threshold event at Discipline 6

4. **Daily Decay/Passive Changes**
   - Gradual changes over time
   - Example: Soldier Rep slowly drifts toward 0

**Conflict Resolution:**
- All changes logged with source category
- Changes accumulate (not override) within same tick
- Managers clamp final value to valid range
- If conflicting changes occur, review logs to identify source

### Company Needs

**Managed By:** `CompanyNeedsManager`

**Tracks:**
- Readiness (0-100)
- Morale (0-100)
- Supply (0-100)
- Rest (0-100)

**Priority Order:**

1. **Order Requirements**
   - Orders can set minimum need values
   - Example: Scout order requires Readiness 50+

2. **Direct Player Actions**
   - Decisions affecting company needs
   - Example: "Share Extra Rations" decision increases Morale

3. **Battle/Major Events**
   - Significant state changes from major events
   - Example: Battle decreases Readiness and Equipment

4. **Daily Decay**
   - Gradual decline during march
   - Faster decline during forced march
   - Slower decline during rest

5. **Automatic Recovery**
   - Gradual increase when camped
   - Faster in towns/villages

**Conflict Resolution:**
- All changes accumulate within same tick
- Final value clamped to 0-100
- Critical thresholds (below 30) trigger warning events

**Orchestrator Integration (NEW 2026-01-03):**
- `WorldStateAnalyzer` reads Company Needs to determine `LifePhase` (Routine/Strained/Crisis)
- `SimulationPressureCalculator` tracks sustained pressure (days below threshold)
- Activity level affects opportunity budget (fewer opportunities when stressed)
- **Future Enhancement:** Gradient need influence on opportunity fitness scoring (see [Systems Integration Analysis](../../ANEWFEATURE/systems-integration-analysis.md))

### Gold (Player Treasury)

**Managed By:** `GiveGoldAction` (native Bannerlord)

**Sources:**
- Pay system (weekly wages)
- Event rewards
- Decision outcomes (gambling, side work)
- Order bonuses
- Selling equipment (quartermaster)

**Costs:**
- Retinue wages (weekly deduction)
- Equipment purchases (quartermaster)
- Provisions purchases (quartermaster)
- Event costs (bribes, gambling losses)
- Medical treatment costs

**Priority Order:**

1. **Mandatory Deductions** (retinue wages, issued equipment damage fees)
2. **Player Purchases** (equipment, provisions)
3. **Event Costs** (player chose the option)
4. **Pay Income** (weekly wage deposit)
5. **Event Rewards** (bonus income)

**Conflict Resolution:**
- All gold changes use `GiveGoldAction.ApplyBetweenCharacters()`
- Purchases blocked if insufficient funds
- Negative balance not allowed (purchase validation required)

### Fatigue

**Managed By:** `FatigueManager`

**Range:** 0-100 (0 = fully rested, 100 = exhausted)

**Sources of Increase:**
- Marching (daily increase based on speed)
- Battle participation
- Training decisions (weapon drill, sparring)
- Forced march (accelerated increase)
- Camp activities (some decisions cost fatigue)

**Sources of Decrease:**
- Rest decision (manual)
- Camped state (automatic recovery)
- Town rest (faster recovery)
- Medical treatment (side effect of recovery)

**Priority Order:**

1. **Critical States** (battle, forced march) - highest accumulation
2. **Player Rest Decisions** - immediate relief
3. **Daily Accumulation** - marching fatigue
4. **Passive Recovery** - camped rest
5. **Decision Costs** - training and activities

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Multiple fatigue sources accumulate within same tick
- Value clamped to 0-100
- High fatigue (70+) blocks some decisions
- Exhaustion (90+) triggers warning events

### Equipment (Player Loadout)

**Sources:**
- Issued gear (automatic at enlistment, promotions)
- Quartermaster purchases
- Quartermaster upgrades
- Event rewards (rare)
- Battlefield loot (via native game)

**Restrictions:**
- Tier gates (equipment locked by rank)
- Reputation gates (quartermaster sell access)
- Baggage train availability (affects purchases/sells)
- Gold availability (purchase validation)

**Priority Order:**

1. **Issued Equipment** - mandatory gear for rank/role
2. **Player Purchases** - via quartermaster
3. **Event Rewards** - rare equipment gifts
4. **Reclamation on Discharge** - issued items taken back

**Conflict Resolution:**
- System tracks issued vs purchased items
- Issued items automatically upgraded at promotions
- Players can't sell issued equipment
- Baggage availability gates all transactions

## Content Validation Rules

These rules help prevent content conflicts. Many are not yet enforced by tooling.

### Event/Decision Requirements

**Rule 1: No Impossible Tier × Role Combinations**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "minTier": 1,
    "maxTier": 3,
    "role": "Officer"
  }
}
```
**Why:** Players can't be Officers at T1-T3 (Officers start at T5).

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "minTier": 5,
    "role": "Officer"
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- If `role == "Officer"` then `minTier >= 5`
- If `role == "NCO"` then `minTier >= 4`
- Role-specific events should have appropriate tier requirements

---

**Rule 2: Context Requirements Must Be Achievable**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "context": "Battle"
  },
  "timing": {
    "cooldownDays": 1
  }
}
```
**Why:** Camp decisions can't fire during battles (Camp Hub unavailable during MapEvent).

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "context": "Any"
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- Camp Hub decisions (`dec_*`) must use `context: "Any"` or camp-appropriate contexts
- Battle-specific content should use map incidents, not decisions

---

**Rule 3: Skill Requirements Must Match Role**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "role": "Engineer",
    "minSkills": {
      "Medicine": 50
    }
  }
}
```
**Why:** Engineers use Engineering skill, not Medicine.

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "role": "Engineer",
    "minSkills": {
      "Engineering": 50
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- Cross-reference role definitions with skill requirements
- Warn about mismatches between role and required skills

---

**Rule 4: Escalation Triggers Must Match Track Type**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "escalation_requirements": {
      "scrutiny": 5,
      "pay_tension_min": 85
    }
  }
}
```
**Why:** `scrutiny` is 0-10 scale, `pay_tension_min` is 0-100 scale. Using both in single event is suspicious.

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "triggers": {
    "escalation_requirements": {
      "scrutiny": 5
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- Events should focus on one escalation track per event
- Combining multiple tracks should be intentional (multi-cause events)

---

**Rule 5: Cooldowns Must Be Reasonable**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "id": "dec_rest",
  "timing": {
    "cooldownDays": 30
  }
}
```
**Why:** Rest is a core decision that should be available frequently.

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "id": "dec_rest",
  "timing": {
    "cooldownDays": 1
  }
}
```

**Validation Guidelines:**
- Core decisions (rest, training): 1-2 days
- Social/economic decisions: 3-7 days
- Rare/special decisions: 14-30 days
- Major events: 30-60 days
- One-time events: No cooldown needed

---

**Rule 6: Mutually Exclusive Events Need Flags**

**Pattern:** Multi-stage events (player choice leads to follow-up)

✅ **Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "evt_mutiny_opportunity",
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "join_mutiny",
      "effects": {
        "setFlags": ["mutiny_joined"]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "report_mutiny",
      "effects": {
        "setFlags": ["mutiny_reported"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then follow-up events:
```json
{
  "id": "evt_mutiny_result_joined",
  "triggers": {
    "all": ["has_flag:mutiny_joined"],
    "none": ["has_flag:mutiny_resolved"]
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- Events that set flags should have follow-up events
- Follow-up events should check for flag AND set resolution flag
- No infinite loops (flag set but never cleared)

---

**Rule 7: HP Requirements Only for Medical Decisions**

❌ **Invalid:**
```json
{
  "id": "dec_challenge_duel",
  "requirements": {
    "hp_below": 50
  }
}
```
**Why:** HP requirements are for medical treatment, not general decisions.

✅ **Valid:**
```json
{
  "id": "dec_seek_treatment",
  "requirements": {
    "hp_below": 90
  }
}
```

**Validation Check:**
- `hp_below` should only appear in medical-themed events
- Regular decisions shouldn't gate on HP (use fatigue instead)

---

**Rule 8: Localization References Must Exist**

**Required Check:**
- Every `titleId` has matching entry in `enlisted_strings.xml`
- Every `setupId` has matching entry
- Every option `textId` has matching entry
- Every `resultTextId` has matching entry

**Validation Tool Enhancement:**
```python
# Load all string IDs from XML
xml_ids = load_enlisted_strings_ids()

# Check each event
for event in events:
    if event['titleId'] not in xml_ids:
        warn(f"Missing string: {event['titleId']}")
    if event['setupId'] not in xml_ids:
        warn(f"Missing string: {event['setupId']}")
    # Check options...
```

---

**Rule 9: Weighted Events Must Have Valid Priorities**

**Priority Ranges:**
- **Critical** (80-100): Escalation thresholds, crisis events
- **High** (60-79): Role-specific events, major story beats
- **Normal** (40-59): Standard events (default)
- **Low** (20-39): Flavor events, social interactions
- **Rare** (1-19): Easter eggs, rare occurrences

**Validation Check:**
- Events with `oneTime: true` should have high priority
- Threshold events should have priority 70+
- Universal flavor events should have priority 20-40

---

**Rule 10: Option Counts and Tooltips**

**Requirements:**
- Every event must have 2-4 options
- Every option must have a tooltip (tooltips cannot be null)
- Tooltips must be under 80 characters
- Tooltips must be factual, concise descriptions

**Validation:**
```python
for event in events:
    options = event.get('options', [])
    if not (2 <= len(options) <= 4):
        error(f"Event {event['id']} has {len(options)} options (need 2-4)")
    
    for opt in options:
        if not opt.get('tooltip'):
            error(f"Option {opt['id']} missing tooltip (tooltips cannot be null)")
        elif len(opt['tooltip']) > 80:
            warn(f"Option {opt['id']} tooltip too long ({len(opt['tooltip'])} chars)")
```

---

### Validation Tool Enhancements Needed

Current `validate_events.py` only checks duplicate IDs and option counts. It should be enhanced to check:

**Phase 1: Structure Validation**
- [ ] JSON schema validation (correct field names, types)
- [ ] Required fields present (id, category, titleId, setupId)
- [ ] Valid enum values (category, role, context, etc.)
- [ ] Option count (2-4 range)
- [ ] Tooltip presence and length

**Phase 2: Reference Validation**
- [ ] All string IDs exist in enlisted_strings.xml
- [ ] All skill names match Bannerlord skills
- [ ] All trait names match defined traits
- [ ] All flag references documented somewhere

**Phase 3: Logical Validation**
- [ ] No impossible tier × role combinations
- [ ] Reasonable cooldown values
- [ ] Context appropriate for delivery mechanism
- [ ] HP requirements only in medical events
- [ ] Escalation thresholds within valid ranges

**Phase 4: Consistency Checks**
- [ ] Flag-setting options have follow-up events
- [ ] Multi-stage events properly sequenced
- [ ] One-time events have appropriate priority
- [ ] Events don't overlap without clear priority

---

## Testing & Verification

## Adding New Systems

When adding a new feature that interacts with existing systems:

### 1. Document Integration Points

Add entry to [System Integration Points](#system-integration-points) matrix showing:
- What systems it interacts with
- What could conflict
- How conflicts are resolved

### 2. Define State Modification Rules

If your system modifies shared state (reputation, gold, needs, etc.):
- Use existing managers (never modify directly)
- Document priority relative to other systems
- Add to [State Modification Priorities](#state-modification-priorities)

### 3. Add Validation Rules

If your system adds new content types or requirements:
- Define validation rules
- Add examples of valid/invalid configurations
- Update validation tool if needed

### 4. Add Test Scenarios

Add integration test scenarios covering:
- Normal operation
- Edge cases (discharge, capture, battle)
- Conflict scenarios with other systems
- State persistence across save/load

### 5. Update Conflict Detection

If your system uses Harmony patches:
- Check `ModConflictDiagnostics` output after adding patches
- Document any expected conflicts
- Test with popular mods

If your system affects event eligibility:
- Document requirement interactions
- Add trigger conditions for mutual exclusion if needed
- Test event delivery with other active systems

### Example: Adding Baggage Train Availability

**Step 1: Integration Points**
```
Baggage Train × Quartermaster
  - Sell equipment requires baggage access
  - Provisions shop requires baggage access
  - Dialogue variants for unavailable state

Baggage Train × Retinue
  - Trickle reinforcements blocked when unavailable
  - Events mention baggage state

Baggage Train × Context
  - Unavailable during forced march
  - Unavailable far from army
  - Available at valid musters
```

**Step 2: State Access Rules**
```csharp
// All systems check availability before baggage access
if (!BaggageTrainAvailability.CanAccessBaggage(out string reason))
{
    // Block access, show reason
    return;
}
```

**Step 3: Validation Rules**
```
- Events that give equipment should check baggage availability
- Decisions that require baggage should have context requirements
- QM dialogue must have unavailable variants
```

**Step 4: Test Scenarios**
```
- Start forced march → expect baggage blocked
- Try QM provisions → expect blocked with reason
- End forced march → expect access restored
- Save/load during unavailable → expect state persists
```

**Step 5: Conflict Detection**
```
- No Harmony patches (uses existing systems)
- No new event requirements (uses existing context checks)
- Logs show availability checks with reasons
```

## Summary

### Quick Reference

**When adding content (events/decisions):**
1. Run `validate_events.py` before committing
2. Check requirements for impossible combinations
3. Add appropriate cooldowns
4. Use flags for multi-stage events
5. Add localization strings
6. **NEW:** Add `hint`/`hintId` for camp opportunities (narrative foreshadowing)
7. Test with existing events

**When adding features:**
1. Document integration points
2. Use existing managers for state changes
3. Add test scenarios
4. Check for Harmony conflicts
5. Update this document
6. **NEW:** Consider orchestrator integration (does it need pre-scheduling?)

**Orchestrator Rules (NEW 2026-01-03):**
1. Opportunities scheduled at 6am daily tick
2. Never regenerate opportunities during the day
3. Query `ContentOrchestrator.GetCurrentPhaseOpportunities()` (no cache)
4. Mark consumed with `ConsumeOpportunity()` or `ConsumeOpportunityByDecisionId()`
5. Decision-category events must NOT appear in MapIncidentManager

**When debugging conflicts:**
1. Check `Conflicts-A_*.log` for mod conflicts
2. Check `Session-A_*.log` for state change sources
3. Review integration matrix for affected systems
4. Test edge cases (battle, discharge, capture)

**Validation Priorities:**

1. **Critical** (blocks merge): Duplicate IDs, invalid JSON, mod conflicts
2. **High** (fix before release): Missing localizations, impossible requirements, broken cooldowns
3. **Medium** (fix soon): Overlapping events, suspicious skill checks, priority issues
4. **Low** (enhance later): Tooltip improvements, consistency polish, rare edge cases

## Error Codes Reference

Error codes are used throughout the mod for structured logging and debugging. Each system has a unique prefix.

### Muster System (E-MUSTER-xxx)

| Code | Description | Recovery |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `E-MUSTER-001` | Menu registration failed | Falls back to legacy inquiry popup |
| `E-MUSTER-002` | Stage transition or init failed | Jumps to muster complete or aborts |
| `E-MUSTER-003` | State restoration failed (save/load) | Aborts muster, defers to next cycle |
| `E-MUSTER-004` | Effect application failed | Continues muster, shows warning |
| `E-MUSTER-005` | Unhandled exception | Aborts muster, falls back to legacy or defers |

### Incident System (E-INCIDENT-xxx)

| Code | Description | Recovery |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `E-INCIDENT-005` | Pay muster inquiry failed | Defers muster to next cycle |

### Content Orchestrator (E-ORCHESTRATOR-xxx, NEW 2026-01-03)

| Code | Description | Recovery |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `E-ORCHESTRATOR-001` | Opportunity scheduling failed | Logs error, continues with empty schedule |
| `E-ORCHESTRATOR-002` | Hint generation failed | Logs error, continues without hints |
| `E-ORCHESTRATOR-003` | Consumption failed | Logs error, attempts fallback by decision ID |
| `E-ORCHESTRATOR-004` | World state analysis failed | Logs error, uses default activity level |

### Event Delivery (E-EVENT-xxx, E-DECISION-xxx, NEW 2026-01-03)

| Code | Description | Recovery |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `E-EVENT-001` | Event effect application failed | Logs error, continues without effects |
| `E-EVENT-002` | Localization string missing | Logs error, shows fallback text |
| `E-DECISION-001` | Decision consumption failed | Logs error, attempts cleanup |

### General Patterns

All error codes follow the format `E-SYSTEM-NNN` where:
- `E` = Error (vs `W` for Warning)
- `SYSTEM` = System identifier (MUSTER, INCIDENT, CONTENT, etc.)
- `NNN` = Numeric code within that system

Errors are logged via `ModLogger.ErrorCode()` which includes:
- Error code for searchability
- Human-readable message
- Full exception stack trace (when applicable)
