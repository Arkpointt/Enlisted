## Summary

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Orders** | 17 | Military directives from chain of command (see [Orders Content](orders-content.md)) |
| **Order Events** | 84 | Events that fire during order execution (17 order types in `ModuleData/Enlisted/Orders/order_events/`) |
| **Decisions** | 37 | Player-initiated choices from Camp Hub (3 core + 26 camp + 8 medical with sea variants) |
| **Context Events** | 65 | Context-triggered situations (escalation, pay, promotion, retinue, illness, baggage, pressure arcs) |
| **Map Incidents** | 51 | Triggered by map actions (battle, siege, settlement entry/exit, waiting) - includes retinue incidents |
| **Total** | **254** | Full content catalog including all systems (verified by Tools/count_content.py) |

**Training Decisions**: 3 weapon-aware training decisions using dynamic skill XP. Uses `reward_choices` and `dynamic_skill_xp` for equipped weapon training. See [Training System](../Features/Combat/training-system.md) for implementation details.

**Selection Algorithm**: Intelligent selection algorithm implemented. Events fire automatically every 3-5 days based on player role (2× weight for matching), context (1.5× weight for matching), and priority. Global pacing limits prevent spam: max 2 events per day, 8 per week, minimum 6 hours between any automatic events. Limits are config-driven (see `enlisted_config.json` → `decision_events.pacing`). See `EventSelector.cs`, `EventPacingManager.cs`, `MapIncidentManager.cs`, and `GlobalEventPacer.cs`.

## Camp Opportunities (36 total)

**File:** `ModuleData/Enlisted/Decisions/camp_opportunities.json`  
**System:** Pre-scheduled by ContentOrchestrator 24 hours ahead  
**Delivery:** All today's opportunities visible in menu (commitment model)  
**Integration:** Each opportunity links to a decision via `targetDecision` field

**How It Works (Phase-Aware Scheduling & Commitment Model - 2026-01-04):**
1. **Daily at 6am:** ContentOrchestrator analyzes world state and pre-schedules opportunities
2. **Phase-aware generation:** For each phase (Dawn/Midday/Dusk/Night):
   - Calls `CampOpportunityGenerator.GenerateCandidatesForPhase(phase)` 
   - Generator overrides context to target phase (not current phase)
   - Ensures candidates are filtered by their target phase's `validPhases`
   - Tracks `alreadyScheduledIds` to prevent same opportunity in multiple phases
3. **Fitness scoring:** All opportunities compete on fitness (context, player needs, history, schedule awareness)
4. **Budget selection:** Top N opportunities per phase selected based on activity level budget
5. **Duplicate prevention:** Each opportunity appears only ONCE per day in its first valid phase
6. **Schedule locking:** Locked once generated (won't change when context shifts)
7. **Menu displays ALL phases:** `GetAllTodaysOpportunities()` shows opportunities for entire day
8. **Player commitment:**
   - **Future-phase opportunities:** Click to schedule → greys out with "[SCHEDULED - {Phase}]"
   - **Current/past-phase opportunities:** Click to fire immediately (no commit for past phases)
   - **Phase transition:** Auto-fires all committed opportunities as popups
   - **Missed opportunities:** Uncommitted opportunities disappear when phase passes
9. **Baggage filtering:** Only shows baggage access when player actually has access (prevents "access denied" frustration)

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Players can see and plan for entire day's opportunities
- ✅ Click future opportunities to schedule them (commit)
- ✅ Committed opportunities auto-fire at designated phase
- ✅ Visual feedback (grey out) shows scheduled state
- ✅ Missed opportunities just disappear (no popup spam)
- ✅ Baggage access only appears when accessible
- ✅ Opportunities persist when lord leaves or context changes

**See:** [ORCHESTRATOR-OPPORTUNITY-UNIFICATION.md](../../ORCHESTRATOR-OPPORTUNITY-UNIFICATION.md) for complete architecture and commitment model details.
