## Overview

Orders are multi-day duty assignments that progress through phases (4 per day). Each order defines:
- **Duration** - How many days/phases
- **Skills** - Primary and secondary skills for checks
- **Consequences** - Fatigue accumulation, injury risk
- **Blocks** - Sequence of phases with types (routine, slot, checkpoint, resolve)
- **Event Pool** - Which events can fire during this order

### Order Count Summary

## Naval Order Handling

Orders support naval awareness for the Warsails DLC. The system handles three scenarios:

### 1. Sea Context Variants (T1-T3)

Basic soldier orders have nautical text variants that display when the party is at sea:

| Order | Land Title | Sea Title |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Guard Duty | Guard Duty | Deck Watch |
| Camp Patrol | Camp Patrol | Hull Inspection |
| Firewood Collection | Firewood Collection | Deck Scrubbing |
| Equipment Inspection | Equipment Inspection | Rigging Check |
| Sentry Post | Sentry Post | Masthead Watch |
| Muster Inspection | Muster Inspection | Deck Muster |

**Dynamic Display:** Context variants are applied dynamically whenever an order is displayed to the player using `OrderCatalog.GetDisplayTitle()` and `OrderCatalog.GetDisplayDescription()`. This means if a party goes to sea after an order was issued on land, the order will automatically show its sea variant ("Hull Inspection" instead of "Camp Patrol") throughout all UI elements.

**Detection:** Uses `MobileParty.IsCurrentlyAtSea == true` via `OrderCatalog.GetCurrentTravelContextKey()` to determine current context at display time.

**Implementation Note (2026-01-03):** The Order object itself is never mutated - `order.Title` and `order.Description` always retain their base values. Context variants are applied only during display rendering, ensuring the same order shows the correct variant regardless of how many times the party transitions between sea and land.

### 2. Land-Only Orders (T4-T6)

Specialist orders that require leaving camp are blocked at sea with `"not_at_sea": true`:

| Order | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Scout the Route | Can't ride ahead on horseback at sea |
| Forage Supplies | Can't take a cart into the countryside |
| Lead a Patrol | Can't patrol the woods from a ship |
| Inspect Defenses | Walls and fortifications are at settlements |

These orders are filtered out during selection when at sea and won't be issued.

### 3. Order Cancellation on Embarkation

If the party boards a ship while a land-only order is active, the order is automatically cancelled:

- `OrderManager.CheckNavalOrderConflict()` runs every hour
- Detects when party goes to sea with an active `not_at_sea` order
- Cancels the order and clears state
- Shows notification: "{Order Title} stood down - boarding ship"
- Reports to news system for Daily Brief

**Example:** Player is on "Lead a Patrol" duty. Lord's army embarks on ships. The order is cancelled with the message "Lead a Patrol stood down - boarding ship" and the player returns to regular duty until a new sea-compatible order is issued.

### 4. Order Event Sea/Land Filtering

**Order events** themselves can use `notAtSea: true` to prevent land-specific events from firing at sea, even if the parent order can run at sea.

**Example:** Guard Duty becomes "Deck Watch" at sea (via `context_variants`), but the event about a noble demanding gate entry should not fire at sea:

```json
{
  "id": "guard_noble_demands",
  "order_type": "order_guard_post",
  "setup": "A well-dressed noble demands entry without proper authorization...",
  "requirements": {
    "world_state": ["peacetime_garrison"],
    "notAtSea": true  // Gate entry doesn't happen at sea
  }
}
```

**When order events use `notAtSea: true`:**
- Event contains land-specific references (tents, fires, walls, gates, forests)
- Event involves land-specific activities (chopping wood, boar hunting, gate control)
- Event describes garrison/fortification contexts (wall infiltrators, perimeter patrols)

**Generic events still fire at sea:**
- Equipment inspection/cleaning (works on ships)
- Interpersonal conflicts (soldiers fight anywhere)
- Relief schedules and exhaustion (universal)
- Officer inspections and tests (work on deck)

This allows orders like "Firewood Collection" → "Deck Scrubbing" to use the same order definition with sea variants, while preventing the "axe slip while chopping wood" event from firing at sea.

**Implementation:** `OrderProgressionBehavior.SelectOrderEvent()` uses `EventRequirementChecker.MeetsRequirements()` to validate all requirement fields including `notAtSea`/`atSea`, tier, role, and other constraints. After filtering by `world_state` (via `FilterByWorldState()`), all remaining requirements are checked comprehensively.

**See:** [Event System Schemas - Order Event Requirements](event-system-schemas.md#order-event-requirements) for complete documentation on order event filtering.
