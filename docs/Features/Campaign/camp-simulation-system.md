# Camp Simulation System: Living Military Company

**Summary:** The Camp Simulation System creates a living, breathing military company through two integrated layers: Background Simulation (autonomous company life that runs automatically) and Camp Opportunities (player-facing activities generated contextually). Together they make the camp feel real - things happen whether you engage or not, and you can choose when and how to participate in camp life.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Implementation:** `src/Features/Camp/CompanySimulationBehavior.cs`, `src/Features/Camp/CampOpportunityGenerator.cs`

## System Overview

### The Two Layers

The Camp Simulation System consists of two complementary layers that work together to create a living military company:

| Layer | Purpose | Player Interaction | Implementation |
|-------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Background Simulation** | Autonomous company life - soldiers get sick, equipment degrades, morale shifts | Observe via news feed | CompanySimulationBehavior |
| **Camp Opportunities** | Contextual activities player can engage with | Choose to participate or ignore | CampOpportunityGenerator |

**How They Work Together:**

```

## Core Philosophy

### You Are One Soldier in a Company

**The camp has its own life.** Things happen whether you act or not:
- Soldiers get sick, injured, or desert
- Equipment breaks, gets stolen, or wears out
- Morale rises and falls based on conditions
- Small incidents occur constantly
- The company consumes supplies, accumulates fatigue, deals with problems

### Two Modes of Engagement

**1. Observe (Background Simulation)**
- You see what happened through the news feed
- "Private Jonas fell ill overnight"
- "Equipment theft in the baggage train"
- "Three men deserted during the march"
- You don't control it - you observe it

**2. Participate (Camp Opportunities)**
- Camp generates activities you can engage with
- Training session starting, card game forming, comrade needs help
- You choose when and how to participate
- Or you ignore it and take your own initiative

### Not a Management Game

**You don't command the company.** You're one soldier among many:
- You can't order training drills (but you can join them)
- You can't prevent desertions (but you can help with morale)
- You can't stop equipment theft (but you can be vigilant)
- You experience camp life, not control it

**Stories emerge from living this life, not from managing systems.**

## System Integration

### How Background Simulation Feeds Orchestrator

```csharp
// ContentOrchestrator reads simulation state
var simulation = CompanySimulationBehavior.Instance;

// Roster health affects event selection
float casualtyRate = simulation.Roster.CasualtyRate;
bool hasManySick = simulation.Roster.SickCount > 5;
bool hasDesertions = simulation.Pressure.RecentDesertions > 0;

// Pressure affects urgency
bool supplyPressure = simulation.Pressure.DaysLowSupplies > 2;
bool moralePressure = simulation.Pressure.DaysLowMorale > 2;

// Use in world state for opportunity generation
worldState["company_stressed"] = supplyPressure || moralePressure;
worldState["high_casualties"] = casualtyRate > 0.2f;
worldState["recent_desertions"] = hasDesertions;
```

### What Orchestrator Does With This

**Event Selection:**
- High casualties → medical opportunities more likely
- Recent desertions → discipline/morale events available
- Supply pressure → foraging/scavenging options appear

**Frequency Adjustment:**
- Stressed company → fewer opportunities (men need rest)
- Healthy company → normal opportunity generation
- Crisis conditions → critical events only

**Crisis Response:**
- When pressure hits threshold → orchestrator queues mandatory crisis event
- Background simulation detects → orchestrator delivers → player must respond

## Background Simulation Systems

### Daily Tick Flow

Six systems run each dawn (6am), in order:

```
Daily Tick (6am)
│
├── 1. CONSUMPTION
│   └── Supplies consumed, equipment used
│
├── 2. ROSTER UPDATES
│   └── Sick recover/worsen, wounded heal, deserters leave
│
├── 3. CONDITION CHECKS
│   └── New sickness, injuries, desertion attempts
│
├── 4. INCIDENT ROLLS
│   └── Random camp incidents (0-2 per day)
│
├── 5. PULSE EVALUATION
│   └── Did morale/supplies/rest cross a threshold?
│
└── 6. NEWS GENERATION
    └── Push all results to news feed
```

### 1. Daily Consumption

**Supplies:**
- Base rate: 1.0 supply/day per 10 soldiers
- Modifiers: Marching +20%, Siege +30%, Winter +25%
- High morale reduces waste by 10%
- Low morale increases waste by 15%

**Equipment Degradation:**
- 2% chance per day per soldier that gear degrades
- Higher in combat (5% during active campaign)
- Weather increases risk (rain +3%, snow +5%)

**Fatigue Accumulation:**
- Marching: +15 fatigue/day
- Siege work: +20 fatigue/day
- Garrison duty: -10 fatigue/day (recovery)

### 2. Roster Updates

**Sick Soldiers:**
- Mild illness: 70% recover after 3 days
- Serious illness: 40% recover after 7 days, 10% worsen
- Critical illness: 20% recover after 14 days, 30% die

**Wounded Soldiers:**
- Light wounds: 80% heal after 5 days
- Moderate wounds: 50% heal after 10 days, 20% worsen
- Serious wounds: 30% heal after 20 days, 15% die

**Deserters:**
- Leave at dawn if they decided to desert
- Roster updated, loss reported to news feed
- Impacts company morale (-2 per desertion)

### 3. Condition Checks (New Issues)

**Sickness Rolls:**
- Base chance: 2% per soldier per day
- Modifiers:
  - Low supplies: +3%
  - Siege: +4%
  - Winter: +2%
  - Recent battles: +2%
  - Crowded (>100 soldiers): +1%

**Injury Rolls (Non-Combat):**
- Base chance: 1% per soldier per day
- Modifiers:
  - Heavy labor: +2%
  - Poor equipment: +1%
  - Rushing (forced march): +3%

**Desertion Attempts:**
- Base chance: 0.5% per soldier per day
- Modifiers:
  - Low morale (<30): +5%
  - Unpaid (backpay owed): +3%
  - High discipline (>70): -2%
  - Recent defeat: +4%
  - In friendly territory: -1%

### 4. Background Incidents

Random camp events that don't require player input:

**Common Incidents (60% chance):**
- Card game turned into argument
- Equipment found missing
- Soldier caught stealing rations
- Minor brawl between men
- Rumors spreading through camp

**Rare Incidents (15% chance):**
- Serious fight requiring intervention
- Equipment theft discovered
- Soldier found drunk on duty
- Contraband discovered in baggage
- Desertion attempt foiled

**0-2 incidents roll per day based on company size and stress level.**

## Company Roster Tracking

### Roster Data Model

```csharp
public class CompanyRoster
{
    // Tracked Soldiers
    public List<TrackedSoldier> Soldiers { get; set; }
    
    // Current Counts
    public int HealthyCount { get; set; }
    public int SickCount { get; set; }
    public int WoundedCount { get; set; }
    public int DeadCount { get; set; }  // Total deaths this enlistment
    public int DesertedCount { get; set; }  // Total desertions
    
    // Rates (for pressure calculation)
    public float CasualtyRate => (DeadCount + DesertedCount) / (float)Math.Max(1, StartingCount);
    public float SickRate => SickCount / (float)Math.Max(1, HealthyCount + SickCount);
    
    // History
    public int StartingCount { get; set; }
    public CampaignTime EnlistmentStart { get; set; }
}

public class TrackedSoldier
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public SoldierCondition Condition { get; set; }
    public int DaysSick { get; set; }
    public int DaysWounded { get; set; }
    public SoldierTroop TroopType { get; set; }
}
```

### Soldier Conditions

| Condition | Description | Recovery Time | Mortality Risk |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Healthy | Normal, fit for duty | N/A | 0% |
| MildIllness | Cold, minor ailment | 3 days | 0% |
| SeriousIllness | Fever, infection | 7 days | 5% |
| CriticalIllness | Severe disease | 14 days | 30% |
| LightWound | Scratches, bruises | 5 days | 0% |
| ModerateWound | Deep cuts, fractures | 10 days | 5% |
| SeriousWound | Major trauma | 20 days | 15% |

## Pulse Events & Cascading Pressure

### Pulse Events

When company needs cross critical thresholds, pulse events fire:

**Supply Crisis (Supplies < 20%):**
- News: "Supplies critically low. Men are hungry."
- Effect: Morale -10, desertion risk +5%
- Opportunity: "Forage for supplies" becomes highly weighted

**Morale Crisis (Morale < 25%):**
- News: "Morale is dangerously low. Mutiny possible."
- Effect: Discipline harder to maintain, desertion risk +8%
- Opportunity: "Talk with men" or "Request leave" prioritized

**Exhaustion Crisis (Rest < 15%):**
- News: "Men are exhausted. Performance suffering."
- Effect: Combat penalties, injury risk +3%
- Opportunity: "Push for rest day" appears

### Cascading Pressure

Pressure cascades from one system to another:

```
Low Supplies → Men hungry → Morale drops → Desertions increase
    ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Foraging      Brawls start   Discipline    Roster shrinks
needed        over food      problems      
    ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
More          Injuries      Scrutiny      Combat
incidents     occur         rises         weakness
```

**Pressure Tracking:**

```csharp
public class CompanyPressure
{
    // Pressure Sources
    public int DaysLowSupplies { get; set; }  // Consecutive days <30%
    public int DaysLowMorale { get; set; }    // Consecutive days <40%
    public int DaysHighScrutiny { get; set; } // Consecutive days >70%
    public int RecentDeaths { get; set; }     // Deaths in last 7 days
    public int RecentDesertions { get; set; } // Desertions in last 7 days
    
    // Total Pressure (0-100)
    public int TotalPressure => CalculateTotal();
    
    private int CalculateTotal()
    {
        int pressure = 0;
        pressure += DaysLowSupplies * 5;      // +5 per day
        pressure += DaysLowMorale * 4;        // +4 per day
        pressure += DaysHighScrutiny * 3;     // +3 per day
        pressure += RecentDeaths * 8;         // +8 per death
        pressure += RecentDesertions * 6;     // +6 per desertion
        return Math.Min(100, pressure);
    }
}
```

## Camp Opportunity Generation

### Intelligence Layers

When generating camp opportunities, the system analyzes four layers:

**Layer 1: World State (Macro Context)**
- Lord situation (garrison, campaign, siege)
- Kingdom war status (peace, active war, desperate)
- Recent world events (battles, sieges)
- Strategic context (offensive, defensive, recovery)

**Layer 2: Camp Context (Meso Context)**
- Day Phase (Dawn, Midday, Dusk, Night)
- Day of week (pay coming? muster soon?)
- Recent camp activity (training yesterday? fight last night?)
- Current orders status (who's on duty? who's off?)
- Camp mood (celebration? mourning? tense?)

**Layer 3: Player State (Micro Context)**
- Physical condition (fatigue, injury, health)
- Economic state (gold, debts, needs)
- Social standing (reputation levels)
- Recent actions (what did player do yesterday?)
- Pending matters (owe debt? promise made?)

**Layer 4: Opportunity History (Meta Context)**
- When was this type last offered?
- Did player engage or ignore it?
- What does player tend to choose?
- Variety maintenance (don't repeat too much)
- Novelty injection (introduce new things periodically)

### Generation Algorithm

```csharp
public List<CampOpportunity> GenerateCampLife()
{
    // Step 0: Check if player can receive opportunities
    if (IsPlayerOnDuty())
        return new List<CampOpportunity>(); // On duty = no opportunities
    
    // Step 1: Analyze all context layers
    var worldState = ContentOrchestrator.Instance.GetCurrentWorldSituation();
    var campContext = AnalyzeCampContext();
    var playerState = AnalyzePlayerState();
    var history = GetOpportunityHistory();
    
    // Step 2: Determine opportunity budget (0-3)
    int maxOpportunities = DetermineOpportunityBudget(worldState, campContext);
    
    // Step 3: Generate candidates
    var candidates = GenerateCandidates(worldState, campContext, playerState);
    
    // Step 4: Score each candidate for fitness
    foreach (var candidate in candidates)
    {
        candidate.Score = CalculateFitness(candidate, worldState, 
                                          campContext, playerState, history);
    }
    
    // Step 5: Select top N by score
    var selected = SelectTopN(candidates, maxOpportunities);
    
    // Step 6: Record presentation for learning
    RecordOpportunityPresentation(selected);
    
    return selected;
}
```

## Fitness Scoring

### How Fitness Works

Each opportunity gets a fitness score (0.0-10.0) based on how well it matches current context:

```csharp
public float CalculateFitness(CampOpportunity opp, 
                              WorldSituation world,
                              CampContext camp,
                              PlayerState player,
                              OpportunityHistory history)
{
    float score = opp.BaseWeight;  // Start with base (typically 1.0)
    
    // World state modifiers
    score *= GetWorldStateModifier(opp, world);
    
    // Time-of-day modifier
    if (!opp.ValidTimeOfDay.Contains(camp.CurrentPhase))
        return 0.0f;  // Invalid time = no show
    
    // Player state modifiers
    score *= GetPlayerStateModifier(opp, player);
    
    // Learning system (70/30 split)
    score *= 0.7f;  // 70% fitness
    score += (history.GetPlayerEngagement(opp) * 0.3f);  // 30% learning
    
    // Variety penalty (recently shown?)
    if (history.LastShown(opp) < 2)  // Shown in last 2 days
        score *= 0.3f;
    
    // Novelty boost (never shown before?)
    if (history.NeverShown(opp))
        score *= 1.2f;
    
    return Math.Min(10.0f, score);
}
```

### Example Scoring

**Scenario:** Garrison duty, morning, player is fatigued but low on gold

```
opp_weapon_drill:
  Base: 1.0
  × World (garrison morning): 1.5
  × Player (high fatigue): 0.5
  × Learning (player always ignores): 0.3
  = 0.225 (low fitness, unlikely to show)

opp_rest:
  Base: 1.0
  × World (garrison quiet): 1.2
  × Player (high fatigue): 2.0
  × Learning (player often chooses): 1.4
  = 3.36 (high fitness, likely to show)

opp_card_game:
  Base: 1.0
  × World (garrison social time): 1.3
  × Player (low gold need): 1.5
  × Learning (player sometimes tries): 1.0
  = 1.95 (moderate fitness)
```

Result: Shows "Rest" and "Card Game", skips "Weapon Drill"

---

## Learning System

### 70/30 Split

Opportunity selection uses a **70% fitness / 30% learning** split:

- **70% Fitness:** How well does this fit the current situation?
- **30% Learning:** How much does player engage with this type?

**Why This Works:**
- Fitness ensures contextual appropriateness (no sparring during siege)
- Learning ensures player sees content they enjoy
- 70/30 balance prevents over-personalization (variety maintained)

### Engagement Tracking

```csharp
public class OpportunityHistory
{
    // Per-opportunity tracking
    Dictionary<string, OpportunityRecord> _records;
    
    public float GetPlayerEngagement(string oppId)
    {
        var record = _records[oppId];
        
        float presentedCount = record.TimesPresented;
        float engagedCount = record.TimesEngaged;
        float ignoredCount = record.TimesIgnored;
        
        // Engagement rate: 0.0 (never engaged) to 1.0 (always engaged)
        return engagedCount / Math.Max(1, presentedCount);
    }
    
    public void RecordPresentation(string oppId)
    {
        _records[oppId].TimesPresented++;
        _records[oppId].LastPresented = CampaignTime.Now;
    }
    
    public void RecordEngagement(string oppId, bool engaged)
    {
        if (engaged)
            _records[oppId].TimesEngaged++;
        else
            _records[oppId].TimesIgnored++;
    }
}
```

### Learning Evolution

Over time, the system learns patterns:

**Week 1:** Player ignores all training, always chooses social/economic
- Learning weight still low (few samples)
- Fitness dominates selection

**Week 4:** Clear pattern established
- Player engagement: Training 0.1, Social 0.8, Economic 0.9
- Learning weight increases selection of social/economic
- But fitness still ensures contextual variety

**Week 12:** Mature profile
- System knows player preferences well
- Still shows occasional training (novelty, variety)
- But heavily weights social/economic opportunities

## Orchestrator Integration

### Content Orchestrator Provides

**WorldStateAnalyzer:**
- LordSituation (garrison/campaign/siege)
- WarStance (peace/active/desperate)
- ActivityLevel (quiet/routine/active/intense)
- DayPhase (dawn/midday/dusk/night)

**SimulationPressureCalculator:**
- TotalPressure (0-100)
- PressureSources (supplies/morale/scrutiny/casualties)
- PressureReleases (pay/victory/rest)

**PlayerBehaviorTracker:**
- Player preferences (combat vs social, risky vs safe)
- Recent behavior patterns
- Engagement history

### Opportunity Generator Uses

```csharp
// In CampOpportunityGenerator.GenerateCampLife()

var orchestrator = ContentOrchestrator.Instance;

// Get world state
var worldState = orchestrator.GetCurrentWorldSituation();
var activityLevel = worldState.ActivityLevel;
var lordSituation = worldState.LordSituation;

// Determine opportunity budget based on activity
int maxOpportunities = activityLevel switch
{
    ActivityLevel.Quiet => 3,      // Garrison = lots of time
    ActivityLevel.Routine => 2,    // Normal operations
    ActivityLevel.Active => 1,     // Campaign = busy
    ActivityLevel.Intense => 0     // Siege = no opportunities
};

// Get company pressure
var pressure = orchestrator.GetSimulationPressure();
bool companyStressed = pressure.TotalPressure > 60;

// Adjust for stress
if (companyStressed)
    maxOpportunities = Math.Max(0, maxOpportunities - 1);

// Generate candidates with world state context
var candidates = GenerateCandidates(worldState, pressure);
```

### Orchestrator Override System

**Added:** 2025-12-31 - The orchestrator now actively manages the camp routine schedule.

**Schedule Overrides:**
The ContentOrchestrator can override the baseline camp schedule when company needs are critical:
- Supplies < 30 → Foraging Duty (replaces training)
- Rest < 20 → Extended Rest (skips formations)
- Readiness < 40 → Emergency Drill (extra training)
- Morale < 25 → Light Duty (morale recovery)

**Variety Injections:**
Periodically (every 3-5 days), the orchestrator injects special assignments to break monotony:
- Patrol Duty, Scouting Assignment, Guard Rotation, etc.

**Automatic Routine Processing:**
At phase boundaries, `CampRoutineProcessor` automatically processes scheduled activities and generates outcomes with dynamic rolls (Excellent/Good/Normal/Poor/Mishap), applying XP, resources, and conditions without player interaction.

**Integration:**
```csharp
// At phase transition
var override = ContentOrchestrator.Instance.CheckForScheduleOverride(phase);
if (override != null)

## Decision Scheduling System (Phase 9)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (2025-12-31)  
**Implementation:** `src/Features/Camp/CampOpportunityGenerator.cs`, `src/Features/Camp/Models/PlayerCommitments.cs`

### Overview

Players can schedule camp opportunities for specific day phases instead of only doing them immediately. This creates anticipation and allows planning around duties.

### How It Works

**Opportunity Scheduling:**
1. Player sees an opportunity (e.g., "sparring match")
2. Can choose to act immediately OR schedule for a specific phase
3. Commitment tracked with phase, day, target decision, display text
4. Shows in AHEAD section with countdown: `"Sparring match at midday (3h)"`
5. When phase arrives, decision fires automatically as popup
6. Removed from commitments after firing

**Day Phases:**
- **Dawn** (6am) - Morning drills, prayers, morning duties
- **Midday** (12pm) - Work details, repairs, training
- **Dusk** (6pm) - Social events, card games, drinking
- **Night** (12am) - Risky activities, sneaking, gambling

**Implementation Details:**
```csharp
// PlayerCommitments.cs
public class ScheduledCommitment
{
    public string OpportunityId { get; set; }
    public string TargetDecision { get; set; }
    public string ScheduledPhase { get; set; }   // Dawn/Midday/Dusk/Night
    public int ScheduledDay { get; set; }
    public string DisplayText { get; set; }
}

// CampOpportunityGenerator.cs
public bool IsCommittedTo(string opportunityId) { ... }
public ScheduledCommitment GetNextCommitment() { ... }
public float GetHoursUntilCommitment(ScheduledCommitment c) { ... }
```

**UI Integration:**
- `ForecastGenerator.BuildNowText()` shows upcoming commitments with countdown
- `CampScheduleManager.ApplyPlayerCommitments()` marks them on schedule
- Phase transition detection fires commitments automatically

**Opportunity Configuration:**
```json
{
  "id": "opp_card_game",
  "scheduledPhase": "Dusk",
  "validPhases": ["Dusk", "Night"],
  "immediate": false
}
```

- `immediate: false` → Player commits, fires at scheduled phase (24h ahead)
- `immediate: true` → Fires now (urgent/time-sensitive activities)

**Benefits:**
- Immersive time awareness (anticipation of scheduled activities)
- Players can plan around duties and obligations
- Natural pacing (activities happen when contextually appropriate)
- Consequences for broken commitments (reputation/discipline)

## Examples

### Example Day: Garrison Morning

**Background Simulation (6am tick):**
```
Supplies consumed: -2 (98/100 remaining)
Private Marcus recovered from illness
No new sickness today
Equipment check: All good
Incident roll: Card game argument (minor)
Pulse check: All needs normal
News: "Private Marcus is back on his feet."
```

**Camp Opportunities (player opens menu at 8am):**
```
World: Garrison, Dawn, Peacetime
Camp: Morning, good mood, no recent activity
Player: Rested, moderate gold, good rep

Generated opportunities:
1. Weapon Training (fitness: 3.2)
2. Card Game (fitness: 2.1)
3. Help Wounded (fitness: 1.8)

Shows: Weapon Training, Card Game
```

### Example Day: Siege Afternoon

**Background Simulation (6am tick):**
```
Supplies consumed: -4 (siege modifier, 45/100 remaining)
Two soldiers fell ill (siege conditions)
One desertion attempt foiled
Equipment degradation: 3 items damaged
Incident roll: Fight over rations
Pulse check: Low supplies warning (45%)
News: "Supplies are running low. Men are worried."
News: "A fight broke out over rations last night."
```

**Camp Opportunities (player opens menu at 2pm):**
```
World: Siege, Midday, Desperate War
Camp: Afternoon, tense mood, recent fight
Player: Exhausted, low gold, stressed

Generated opportunities:
0 (siege = intense = no opportunities)

Shows: Empty (no time for camp activities during siege)
```
