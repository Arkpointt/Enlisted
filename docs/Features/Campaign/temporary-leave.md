## Overview

Temporary Leave is a suspension of duty, not a discharge. It is **time-limited** (default 14 days). If you fail to return before the timer expires, you are marked as a deserter.

---

## Requesting Leave

You can request leave through two primary channels:
1.  **Enlisted Status Menu**: A "Request Leave" option is available in the main menu hub.
2.  **Lord Dialogue**: You can speak directly with your lord to request time away from the unit.

Approval is generally granted unless the unit is in a high-tempo situation (e.g., active siege or imminent battle).

## The Leave State

Once on leave:
-   **Visibility**: Your party becomes visible and active on the campaign map.
-   **Movement**: You can move freely, trade, and engage in encounters as a vanilla mercenary/lord.
-   **Persistence**: Your rank, XP, reputation, and service record are frozen and preserved.
-   **Restrictions**: You cannot join other factions or enlist with foreign lords while on leave from your current post.

---

## Returning to Service

To resume your duties, you must find and speak with your lord.
-   Selecting "Reporting for duty" immediately restores your enlisted state.
-   Your party is hidden, and you resume following the lord's army.

---

## Transferring Service

While on leave, you have the option to transfer your service to a **different lord within the same faction**.
-   Speak with another lord of your kingdom.
-   Select the option to transfer your service.
-   All progression (tier, XP, reputation) is maintained with the new commander.

---

## Leave Expiration (Abandonment)

If the leave timer reaches zero before you return:
-   **Service Terminated**: You are automatically discharged as having abandoned your post.
-   **Desertion Penalties**: Heavy relation hits with your lord and faction leader.
-   **Cooldown**: You may be blocked from re-enlisting with that faction for a significant duration.
-   **Gear**: Any Quartermaster-issued gear is considered stolen, and a crime rating is applied.
