# Retinue System

**Summary:** The retinue system provides high-rank enlisted commanders (T7+) with a personal military force. Players select their formation type at T7, manage reinforcements through context-aware trickle and lord requests, track loyalty, respond to narrative events, and lead named veterans through battles. The system transforms gameplay from individual soldier to commander of men.

## Overview

As you advance into the Commander tiers (T7-T9), you are assigned a personal squad of soldiers. These troops are embedded within your formation and look to you for leadership. The retinue system provides:

- **Formation Choice**: Select infantry, archers, cavalry, or horse archers at T7
- **Context-Aware Replenishment**: Reinforcements arrive faster after victories, slower after defeats
- **Relation-Based Requests**: Request reinforcements from your lord with pricing based on relationship
- **Loyalty Tracking**: Maintain your soldiers' morale through choices and care
- **Narrative Events**: 10 retinue-specific events with meaningful command decisions
- **Post-Battle Incidents**: 6 map incidents firing after battles with retinue present
- **Camp Decisions**: 4 commander-specific decisions for inspections, drills, and morale
- **Named Veterans**: Individual soldiers emerge with names, traits, and battle histories
- **News Integration**: Retinue activities appear in Personal Feed and Daily Brief

---

## Command Progression

Your retinue size scales with your enlistment tier:

| Tier | Rank Track | Soldiers | Total Force |
|------|------------|----------|-------------|
| T1-T6 | Enlisted/Officer | 0 | Companions Only |
| T7 | Commander I | 20 | 20 + Companions |
| T8 | Commander II | 30 | 30 + Companions |
| T9 | Commander III | 40 | 40 + Companions |

**Proving Events:**

Promotions to Commander ranks trigger proving events where your lord summons you:
- **T6→T7**: "Commander's Commission" - Accept immediate command or request later via dialog
- **T7→T8**: "Expanded Command" - Lord acknowledges your success, grants 10 more soldiers
- **T8→T9**: "Elite Commander" - Recognition as veteran leader, final 10 soldiers granted

**Player Agency:**

You can decline promotions and request them later via lord dialog. The "My lord, I have proven myself..." option appears when you're eligible for T7+ and have declined.

---

## Formation Selection

### First-Time Selection (T7 Promotion)

When first promoted to T7, you choose your retinue's formation type via dialog:

**Formation Options:**
- **Infantry** - Foot soldiers with sword and shield
- **Archers** - Skilled bowmen for ranged support
- **Cavalry** - Mounted lancers, swift and deadly
- **Horse Archers** - Mounted bowmen of the steppe (culture-restricted)

**Culture Restrictions:**

Horse archers are only available for cultures that historically used them:
- **Available**: Aserai, Khuzait, Empire
- **Not Available**: Vlandia, Battania, Sturgia

**Muster Acknowledgment:**

At the next pay muster after T7 promotion, a **Retinue Muster** stage appears showing:
- Initial retinue capacity (20/20 soldiers)
- Morale and equipment status
- Recruitment options if openings exist
- See [Muster Menu System](muster-menu-revamp.md#7-retinue-muster-menu-t7-only) for details

**Selection Dialog:**

```
Title: "Choose Your Retinue"

Setup: "As a Commander, you lead your own soldiers. 
Choose the type of troops you wish to command."

[Infantry] [Archers] [Cavalry] [Horse Archers*]

*Horse Archers shown only for appropriate cultures
```

**Persistent Choice:**

Your selection is stored in `RetinueState.SelectedTypeId` and persists through:
- T8/T9 expansions (no re-selection, additional soldiers match your formation)
- Save/load
- Discharge and re-enlistment (until you enlist with incompatible culture)

**Culture Mismatch Handling:**

If you re-enlist with a lord whose culture doesn't support your previous formation (e.g., had horse archers with Khuzait, now enlist with Vlandia), you must select a new formation type.

---

## Granting Recruits

### Initial Grant at T7

When you accept T7 promotion (via event or dialog):
1. Formation selection dialog appears (if first time at T7)
2. You choose formation type
3. 20 raw recruits of selected type are added to your party
4. Notification: "Twenty raw recruits have joined your command."

### Expansion Grants at T8/T9

**T8 Promotion:**
- Adds 10 additional recruits of your existing formation type
- No formation re-selection
- Notification acknowledges expanded command

**T9 Promotion:**
- Adds final 10 recruits of your existing formation type
- Reaches maximum retinue capacity
- Notification acknowledges elite commander status

### Recruit Quality

**Culture Integration:**

Recruits match your enlisted lord's culture troop tree:
- **Vlandia**: Vlandian Levy, Vlandian Infantry Recruit, etc.
- **Khuzait**: Khuzait Nomad, Khuzait Archer, etc.
- **Empire**: Imperial Recruit, Imperial Vigla Recruit, etc.

**Formation Matching:**

The system selects the lowest-tier troop from your lord's culture that matches your formation:
- Infantry: Finds troops in Infantry formation class
- Archers: Finds troops in Ranged formation class
- Cavalry: Finds troops in Cavalry formation class
- Horse Archers: Finds troops in HorseArcher formation class

---

## Reinforcement System

The reinforcement system uses two mechanisms: automatic context-aware trickle and relation-based manual requests.

### Context-Aware Trickle

Reinforcements arrive automatically based on campaign context. The system tracks your last battle and adjusts trickle rates accordingly.

**Trickle Rates:**

| Context | Rate | Narrative |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Victory** (within 3 days) | 1 per 2 days | Battle survivors join up |
| **Defeat** (within 5 days) | BLOCKED | Morale recovering |
| **Friendly Territory** | 1 per 3 days | Local levies assigned |
| **At Peace** (5+ days no battle) | 1 per 2 days | Training complete |
| **On Campaign** (default) | 1 per 4 days | Rearguard transfers |

**Context Detection:**

The system uses `RetinueState.LastBattleTime` and `RetinueState.LastBattleWon` to determine context:
- Recent victory: Faster reinforcements (post-battle survivors)
- Recent defeat: Blocked reinforcements (morale must recover)
- Friendly territory: Bonus reinforcements (local recruitment)
- Peace time: Faster reinforcements (training camps productive)

**Friendly Territory Detection:**

Uses `Settlement.FindSettlementsAroundPosition()` to check for friendly settlements within 30 map units of lord's party.

**Contextual Notifications:**

Trickle notifications change based on context:
- Victory: "A survivor from the battle has joined your retinue."
- Friendly Territory: "A local levy has been assigned to your command."
- Default: "A soldier from the rearguard has been transferred to your retinue."

### Request Reinforcements (Relation-Based)

You can manually request reinforcements from your lord via Camp menu, with cost and cooldown based on relationship.

**Access Requirements:**
- Must have selected retinue formation type
- Must be below tier capacity
- Lord relation must be 20+ (blocks hostile lords)

**Relation-Based Terms:**

| Lord Relation | Cost Multiplier | Cooldown | Lord Response |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **50+** (Pleased) | 0.75× (25% discount) | 7 days | "Your men fought well. I can spare some from the reserves." |
| **20-49** (Neutral) | 1.0× (full cost) | 14 days | "Reinforcements? I'll see what I can do. It won't be free." |
| **<20** (Unfriendly) | BLOCKED | N/A | "Improve your standing first." |

**Cost Calculation:**

```
Base Cost per Soldier = CharacterObject.TroopWage × 10
Adjusted Cost = Base Cost × Relation Multiplier
Total Cost = Adjusted Cost × Missing Soldiers
```

**Request Flow:**

1. Open Camp menu → "Retinue" → "Request Reinforcements from [LORD]"
2. Dialog shows relation tier, cost, cooldown
3. Accept: Pay gold, receive soldiers immediately
4. Cooldown applied (7 or 14 days)

**Menu Status Display:**

The Retinue menu shows:
- Current retinue count vs capacity
- Last battle outcome and days since
- Trickle status:
  - "Replacements delayed (morale recovering)" if post-defeat
  - "New recruit expected: N days" if active
  - "Resume in: N days" if blocked
- Territory status (Friendly / Hostile)
- Next request available date

### Post-Battle Volunteer Event

After victorious battles (T7+ with retinue below capacity), the `evt_ret_post_battle_volunteers` event may fire:

**Event Setup:**

"The battle is won. As your men regroup, you notice soldiers from other units looking your way. Your reputation precedes you, Commander.

A corporal approaches. 'Sir, some of the lads want to join your retinue. What should I tell them?'"

**Options:**
- **Accept Volunteers**: +2-4 soldiers, Leadership XP. Leadership 50+ grants +2 bonus.
- **Request Transfers**: +4 soldiers, -5 lord relation (taking from his forces).
- **Decline**: +5 retinue loyalty (quality over quantity).

**Cooldown:** 5 days

---

## Retinue Loyalty

Your retinue has a loyalty track (0-100) representing their morale and devotion. Starts at 50 (neutral).

### Loyalty Effects

| Loyalty Level | Threshold | Effects |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **High** | 80+ | Bonus morale in battle, positive events |
| **Neutral** | 30-79 | Normal operation |
| **Low** | 20-29 | Performance warnings, grumbling events |
| **Critical** | 10-19 | Desertion risk, combat penalties |
| **Near Mutiny** | <10 | Address immediately or lose men |

### Loyalty Modifiers

Actions that affect loyalty:

| Action | Loyalty Change | Context |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Share rations with men** | +5 to +10 | Camp decision, costs gold |
| **Lead from front** | +3 | Participate in battles with retinue |
| **Discipline fairly** | -2 to +2 | Event responses |
| **Protect men from orders** | +10 | Refuse dangerous lord orders |
| **Get men killed recklessly** | -10 to -15 | Heavy casualties without cause |
| **Discipline harshly** | -5 to -10 | Brutal punishment choices |
| **Pay for medical care** | +5 | Camp decision, costs gold |
| **Ignore wounded** | -8 | Event choices |
| **Sacrifice men for lord** | -15 | Event choices |

### Loyalty Threshold Events

Special events fire when loyalty crosses thresholds:

**Low Loyalty (<30):**
- `evt_ret_morale_low` - Men grumbling, morale crisis
- Risk: Must address or face desertion

**High Loyalty (>80):**
- `evt_ret_loyalty_high` - Men devoted, would follow anywhere
- Benefit: Combat bonus, better performance

### Daily Brief Integration

Low or high loyalty appears in Daily Brief context lines:
- Low (<30): "Your men are restless. Morale among your retinue is worryingly low."
- High (>80): "Your soldiers are devoted. They would follow you into any fight."

---

## Training & Development

Retinue soldiers develop through service:

**Combat Experience:**
- Soldiers gain XP naturally through battle participation
- XP scales with enemy difficulty
- Veteran retinue members level faster

**Upgrades:**
- Troops follow their native culture's upgrade tree
- Automatic upgrades when XP thresholds met
- Elite troops emerge after multiple battles

**Manual Training:**

The `dec_ret_drill` Camp Hub decision allows active training:

**Cost:** 1-3 fatigue, 4-day cooldown  
**Options:**
- **Hard Training**: Discipline +3, TroopXP +25, Loyalty -5 (harsh)
- **Balanced Training**: Discipline +2, TroopXP +15, Loyalty ±0
- **Light Training**: Discipline +1, TroopXP +8, Loyalty +3 (gentle)

**Leadership Skill Check:**

Leadership 60+ improves training outcomes, reduces injury risk.

---

## Battle Integration

In battle, your companions and retinue form a **Unified Squad**.

**Deployment:**
- All retinue members spawn in your designated formation
- Formation matches your selected type (Infantry/Archers/Cavalry/Horse Archers)
- Companions join the same formation

**Direct Command:**
- You have direct control using F1-F6 command keys
- Order retinue separately from lord's main force
- Position and tactic orders apply to your squad

**Reinforcement Phases:**
- During battle reinforcement waves, your retinue automatically routes to your position
- Named veterans prioritized in spawn order (if implemented)

**Casualty Tracking:**

The system meticulously tracks retinue health:
1. **Pre-Battle Snapshot**: Retinue state recorded before battle
2. **Battle Participation**: Retinue members fight, may be killed/wounded
3. **Post-Battle Reconciliation**: Casualties calculated, state updated
4. **Recovery**: Wounded soldiers recover over time
5. **News Reporting**: Casualties reported in Personal Feed

---

## Casualty Tracking

### Pre-Battle State

Before each battle, the system records:
- Total retinue count
- Healthy vs wounded split
- Named veteran status

### Post-Battle Reconciliation

After battle ends:
1. Compare pre-battle vs post-battle roster
2. Calculate killed retinue soldiers
3. Calculate wounded retinue soldiers
4. Update `RetinueState.TroopCounts` to match actual roster
5. Check named veteran casualties (see [Named Veterans](#named-veterans))

### Sync Protection

The system syncs `RetinueState` with actual party roster:
- On daily tick
- Before displaying retinue menu
- After every battle

This prevents desync between tracked state and actual soldiers.

### News Reporting

Retinue casualties are reported separately from main force:

**Personal Feed:**
- "Your retinue suffered losses: N killed, M wounded."

**Daily Brief:**
- Includes retinue casualties in casualty report section
- Distinguishes retinue losses from lord's troop losses

---

- `ModuleData/Enlisted/Events/events_retinue.json` - 10 retinue narrative events + volunteer event
- `ModuleData/Enlisted/Events/incidents_retinue.json` - 6 post-battle map incidents
- `ModuleData/Enlisted/Decisions/decisions.json` - 4 retinue camp decisions

### Save/Load Compatibility

All retinue data persists through:

- `RetinueState` includes all new fields (loyalty, battle tracking, veterans)
- `NamedVeteran` list serialized as part of state
- No breaking changes to existing save format
