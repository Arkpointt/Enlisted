# Muster System

**Summary:** The Muster System is a multi-stage GameMenu sequence that occurs every 12 days, guiding players through pay day ceremonies, rank progression displays, and comprehensive period summaries. Replaces the simple pay inquiry popup with an immersive muster experience that integrates pay, rations, and promotion acknowledgments.

## Overview

The pay muster occurs every 12 days (configurable via `payday_interval_days`) and serves as the primary checkpoint for wages, rations, equipment availability, and rank progression. When the muster day arrives, players enter a multi-stage menu sequence that:

1. **Summarizes the 12-day period** - Shows events, battles, gold earned, XP gained
2. **Displays service progression** - Current rank, XP to next rank, unlocks coming
3. **Guides through muster stages** - Pay → Events → Summary
4. **Integrates key events** - Recruit interactions
5. **Provides context for decisions** - Shows pay status, supply levels, unit condition
6. **Creates natural transitions** - Direct links to Quartermaster, Service Records
7. **Generates comprehensive reports** - Final summary saved to news feed

### What Happens at Muster

**Automatic Processes:**
- Fatigue restored to maximum (muster day = rest day)
- Ration exchange (T1-T6: old ration reclaimed, new ration issued based on QM reputation and supply)
- Quartermaster stock refresh (availability re-rolled based on supply)
- Period statistics recorded (XP, gold, battles, casualties)

**Player Choices:**
- Select pay option (accept, recount, side deal, IOU if tension high)
- Mentor/ignore/haze green recruits (T3+, if cooldown ready)
- Acknowledge promotions (if tier increased during period)
- Review retinue status (T7+ commanders)
- Visit Quartermaster or request leave after muster

### Stage Count by Tier

| Tier | Typical Stages | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| T1-T2 | 2-3 stages | Intro → Pay → Complete |
| T3-T6 | 3-4 stages | + Green Recruit? → Promotion? |
| T7-T9 | 4-5 stages | + Retinue Muster |

**Note:** Stages marked with "?" are conditional (only appear if triggered by cooldowns, tier increases, etc.)

---

## Time Control Behavior

The muster menu includes configurable time pause behavior controlled via `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "PauseGameDuringMuster": true
}
```

### Pause Mode (Default: Enabled)

When `PauseGameDuringMuster = true`:
- Game time stops completely during muster
- Time control buttons disabled (locked)
- Player cannot advance time during muster sequence
- Muster feels like an administrative checkpoint outside game time
- Time controls unlock when exiting muster

**Rationale:** Muster is a strategic decision point reviewing period performance and making choices about pay, equipment, and career progression. Pausing prevents attacks, events, or time-sensitive opportunities from expiring while reviewing comprehensive muster data. This is standard for administrative tasks in strategy games.

### Time-Preserving Mode (Optional)

When `PauseGameDuringMuster = false`:
- Game respects player's current time speed (paused, normal, or fast-forward)
- Player can advance time during muster using speed controls
- Allows waiting for movement or passive activities while reviewing muster
- Advanced player preference for workflow flexibility

**Implementation Details:**
- Pause mode: Forces `Campaign.Current.TimeControlMode = CampaignTimeControlMode.Stop` and locks controls
- Time-preserving mode: Uses `QuartermasterManager.CaptureTimeStateBeforeMenuActivation()` pattern and calls `StartWait()` to enable controls

---

## Menu Stages

### 1. Muster Intro

**Menu ID:** `enlisted_muster_intro`

**Purpose:** Provides context for the muster period, displays service record, and shows recent activity.

**Strategic Context Variations:**

The intro text varies based on the army's current situation (detected via `ArmyContextAnalyzer`):

| Context | Flavor Text |
|---------|-------------|
| Coordinated Offensive | "The host prepares for the Grand Campaign. Spirits are high as the sergeants call the muster." |
| Desperate Defense | "The realm bleeds. Muster is brief—every sword is needed on the line." |
| Siege Operation | "The walls loom above. Muster proceeds in the muddy siege lines." |
| Raid Operation | "Smoke rises in the distance. The company assembles between raids." |
| Patrol Peacetime | "A quiet day on the march. The sergeants call muster at the usual hour." |
| Garrison Duty | "Within the castle walls, the garrison assembles for pay day." |
| Winter Camp | "Snow blankets the camp. Men huddle close as the sergeants call muster." |

| Wounded 50-99% | "Health Status: Wounded (X%) - Light duties" |
| Wounded 30-49% | "Health Status: Badly Wounded (X%) - Limited duties" |
| Wounded <30% | "Health Status: Critically Wounded (X%)" |

**Supply Crisis Warning:**

When supply drops below 20%, a warning banner appears:
```
⚠️ CRITICAL SUPPLY - Quartermaster has locked all baggage
```

**Options:**

| Icon | Text | Tooltip | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| 💰 Continue | Proceed to Pay Line | Step forward to receive wages. | → Pay Line stage |

---

### 2. Pay Line

**Menu ID:** `enlisted_muster_pay`

**Purpose:** Present payment options based on lord's financial status and player's situation.

**Display:**

```
💰  PAYMASTER'S LINE  💰

You step forward to the paymaster's table. He opens his ledger.

_____ PAY STATUS _____

Wages Owed:           156 denars
Backpay Outstanding:  0 denars
Lord's Treasury:      Comfortable
```

**Payment Options:**

| Icon | Option | Description | Availability |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 💰 Continue | Accept Your Pay | Receive wages owed. Lord's finances determine full/partial payment. | Always |
| 🎲 TakeQuest | Demand a Recount | Roguery/Charm check. 120% pay on success. 10 fatigue cost. | Always |
| ⚔ Trade | Quartermaster's Deal | Take 40% pay for surplus equipment. 70% chance (your tier). QM rep modifies chance. 6 fatigue. | Always |
| 📜 Manage | Accept Payment in Arrears | Accept delayed payment until next muster. Wages remain owed. Paid at next muster. | Lord can't afford to pay |
| 🏴 Leave | Process Final Discharge | Process discharge. Receive final pay + pension. Service ends. | Pending discharge |
| ⚠ Leave | Smuggle Out (Deserter) | Desert with your gear. Forfeit pension. Hunted as deserter. | Pending discharge |

**Discharge Confirmation:**

When selecting "Process Final Discharge", a confirmation popup appears showing exactly what the player will receive based on their discharge band:

- **Veteran/Heroic Discharge:** Shows 3000 denars severance, pension details with days served, +30 relation, and gear handling (keep armor, weapons to inventory)
- **Honorable Discharge:** Shows 3000 denars severance, pension details with days served, +10 relation, and gear handling
- **Washout Discharge:** Shows no severance, no pension, -10 relation, and all equipment confiscated

The popup uses the native game's `InquiryData` system with Yes/No buttons. The player must confirm before the discharge is processed.

**Payment Outcomes:**

The "Accept Your Pay" option resolves based on the lord's financial status:

- **Full Payment:** Lord pays all pending wages plus backpay. Pay Tension reduced by 30. Clears consecutive delay counter.
- **Partial Payment:** Lord pays current period + 50% of backpay. Pay Tension reduced by 10. Remaining backpay carries forward.
- **Payment Delayed:** Lord cannot afford wages. Backpay accumulates. Pay Tension increases (10 base + 5 per week overdue).

See [Pay System](pay-system.md) for complete details on wage calculation and payment resolution.

Both options process the discharge immediately during the muster sequence (no pending flag or waiting for next muster). Both discharge options now show confirmation popups using the native game's `InquiryData` system, allowing the player to review the consequences and cancel if desired.

## Rank Progression Display

### Current Rank Information

Displayed in the intro stage and final summary:

```
Rank: Corporal (Tier 3)
Days Served This Term: 48 days
Experience: 850 / 2000 XP (43% to Sergeant)

This Period: +120 XP (3 battles, training, orders completed)
```

**Data Sources:**
- Current tier from `EnlistmentBehavior._enlistmentTier`
- Rank name from `progression_config.json` (culture-specific)
- Days served from `EnlistmentBehavior.DaysServed`
- XP requirements from `progression_config.json` per tier
- Period XP calculated as delta from `_xpAtLastMuster`

### XP Sources Breakdown

Displayed in the final summary:

```
XP Sources This Period:
• Daily service: +60 XP (5 XP × 12 days)
• Battles won: +50 XP (3 engagements)
• Orders completed: +20 XP (patrol duty)
• Training: +20 XP (extra drill session)
• Officer reputation gains: +10 XP (order bonus)
```

**Tracking:**
- `EnlistmentBehavior` maintains `_xpSourcesThisPeriod` dictionary
- `AddEnlistmentXP(amount, source)` method tracks sources
- Top 5 sources displayed in breakdown
- Dictionary reset after muster complete

### Promotion Detection

**Logic:**
- Cache `_tierAtLastMuster` from previous muster
- Compare current tier to cached tier at muster start
- If increased, trigger promotion recap stage
- Show promotion date, benefits unlocked, new requirements

---

## Event Integration

The muster system integrates several events that previously fired randomly:

| Event ID | Previous Trigger | New Trigger | Menu Stage |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| `evt_muster_new_recruit` | Random camp, 10-day CD | **During muster**, 10-day CD | Green Recruit |

**Benefits of Integration:**
- Event occurs at appropriate time (muster ceremony)
- Player has context (just saw service record, pay status, supply level)
- Event feels part of muster ritual rather than random interruption
- Cooldown prevents repetition every muster

**Event Filtering:**
- `EventPacingManager` filters `evt_muster_new_recruit` from random camp events
- This event only triggers during the muster menu sequence
- Effects still applied via `EventDeliveryManager.ApplyEffects()`

---

## System Integrations

The muster system integrates with numerous systems across the mod:

### EnlistmentBehavior
- Tracks `_payMusterPending` flag during muster sequence
- Records `_lastMusterCompletionTime` for 6-hour baggage access window
- Maintains `_tierAtLastMuster` and `_xpAtLastMuster` for period calculations
- Tracks `_dayOfLastPromotion` for promotion recap display
- Stores `_xpSourcesThisPeriod` dictionary for XP breakdown

### Pay System
- Pay calculation and lord financial status from [Pay System](pay-system.md)
- Payment options (accept, recount, side deal, IOU) resolved via pay handlers
- Pay Tension increases/decreases based on outcomes
- Discharge processing for pending discharge players

### Quartermaster System
- Stock refresh via `QuartermasterManager.RollStockAvailability()` at muster completion
- Ration exchange for T1-T6 (old ration reclaimed, new ration issued based on QM reputation)
  - First ration is issued at initial enlistment
  - Subsequent musters: exchange old ration for new one
- QM reputation affects baggage inspection options
- Newly unlocked items marked via `UpdateNewlyUnlockedItems()` after tier-up
- Supply <15% blocks QM access entirely (critical supply gate)
- See [Quartermaster System](../Equipment/quartermaster-system.md)

### Baggage Train System
- `BaggageTrainManager.GetCurrentAccess()` returns `FullAccess` during muster
- Muster window grants 6-hour access window after completion
- Supply <20% overrides muster access (Priority 3 Locked state)
- Baggage "caught up" events suppressed during muster
- See [Baggage Train Availability](../Equipment/baggage-train-availability.md)

### Promotion System
- Promotion detection via tier comparison (`_tierAtLastMuster` vs current tier)
- Promotion recap shows benefits unlocked, new abilities, promotion date
- Actual promotion still occurs via `PromotionBehavior` hourly checks and proving events
- See [Promotion System](promotion-system.md)

### Retinue System (T7+)
- Retinue muster stage queries `RetinueManager` for strength, casualties, morale
- Fallen soldiers memorial with names and battle locations
- Post-muster recruitment option if slots available
- See [Retinue System](retinue-system.md)

### News & Reporting
- Period summary queries `EnlistedNewsBehavior.GetPersonalFeedSince(lastMusterDay)`
- Orders summary queries `GetOrderOutcomesSince(lastMusterDay)`
- Muster outcomes recorded via `MusterOutcomeRecord`
- Comprehensive report added to news feed archive
- See [News & Reporting System](../UI/news-reporting-system.md)

### Army Context
- Strategic context flavor text from `ArmyContextAnalyzer.GetCurrentContext()`
- Varies intro text based on situation (offensive, defense, siege, raid, etc.)
- Captured at muster start, doesn't update mid-flow

### Fatigue System
- `EnlistmentBehavior.ResetFatigue()` called at muster start
- Fatigue restored to maximum (muster day = rest day)
- Pay options (recount, side deal) cost fatigue

### Temporary Leave
- Request Leave option in final summary
- Calls `TemporaryLeaveManager.RequestLeave()`
- Available if not in combat/siege and not on probation

## Edge Cases & Special Behaviors

### Combat and Capture Interruption

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Battle starts during muster** | Muster deferred. `_payMusterPending` remains true. Resumes after battle. |
| **Player captured during muster** | Muster canceled. Pay cycle continues while prisoner. Triggers after release. |
| **Lord dies during muster** | Muster canceled. Discharge process begins. |
| **Player deserts during muster** | Muster canceled. Desertion penalties applied. |

### Supply and Equipment Gating

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Supply <30% at muster** | No ration issued. Warning in summary: "No rations available - supplies depleted." |
| **Supply <20% at muster** | Baggage locked (Priority 3 overrides muster access). Banner: "⚠️ CRITICAL SUPPLY - Quartermaster has locked all baggage." |
| **Supply <15% at muster** | QM visit disabled. Tooltip: "Quartermaster unavailable - supplies critically low." |
| **Supply drops <20% mid-muster** | Baggage becomes Locked immediately. Warning if player tries to access. |

### Baggage Access Window

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Muster access window** | 6 hours after muster completion. Tracked via `_lastMusterCompletionTime`. |
| **Player defers muster** | Access window also deferred. No special access until muster proceeds. |
| **Mid-muster baggage access** | Allowed via Camp Hub menu. Doesn't interrupt muster flow. |
| **Multiple access sources** | NCO daily window, Commander halt column, and muster window can coexist. Don't conflict. |
| **Access window expires** | Reverts to normal access evaluation after 6 hours. |

### Orders and Events Summary

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **No orders this period** | Show "No orders assigned this period." |
| **All orders completed** | Show count with positive tone: "Orders: 3 completed, 0 failed - Exemplary service." |
| **All orders failed** | Show count with warning: "Orders: 0 completed, 2 failed - Command is displeased." |

| **FatigueManager unavailable** | Skip fatigue display. Log warning. |

### Quartermaster Integration

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **"Visit QM After" from intro** | Sets flag. After muster completes, opens QM conversation automatically. |
| **"Visit QM" from complete** | Opens QM conversation immediately. Player returns to map after (not back to muster). |
| **Stock refresh during muster** | Called in `CompleteMusterSequence()` before allowing QM access. |
| **Newly unlocked items** | Marked [NEW] after tier-up. All skipped tiers' items if multi-tier promotion. |
| **QM hero unavailable** | Show error message. Disable visit option. Player can dismiss muster. |
| **Stock depleted** | Inventory refresh at muster restores quantities. High-tier items limited (2-5), common items more (5-10). |

### Retinue Edge Cases (T7+)

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Just got retinue (T7 promotion)** | Show initial status: "Retinue: 20/20 soldiers assigned." |
| **Retinue casualties this period** | Show losses with names: "Retinue Losses: 3 soldiers killed, 1 wounded." |
| **Retinue is full (20/20)** | Show "Retinue at capacity." Disable recruit option. |
| **Retinue wiped out (0 soldiers)** | Show "Your retinue has been lost. All soldiers have fallen." Special memorial tone. |
| **No casualties, no changes** | Show "Your retinue stands ready. No losses this period." |

|----------|----------|
| **Request during siege** | Option disabled. Tooltip: "Cannot request leave during active siege." |
| **Request during battle** | Option disabled. Tooltip: "Cannot request leave in combat zone." |
| **On probation** | Option disabled. Tooltip: "Leave denied - currently on probation." |
| **Leave cooldown active** | Show cooldown: "Leave available in X days." |

### Save/Load Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| **Game loaded mid-muster** | Restore `MusterSessionState` from save. Resume at saved stage. |
| **Save corrupted / state missing** | Abort muster. Reset `_payMusterPending = false`. Trigger fresh muster next cycle. |
| **Old save without muster tracking** | Initialize tracking to defaults. First muster shows "Since Enlistment". |

### Error Handling

| Error | Fallback |
|-------|----------|
| **Null EnlistmentBehavior** | Log error, skip muster entirely. Reset pending flag. |
| **Null CompanySupplyManager** | Show supply as "Unknown". Log warning. Continue muster. |
| **Null EnlistedNewsBehavior** | Show "No events recorded." Continue muster. |
| **Stage transition fails** | Log error, jump to Muster Complete stage. Ensure player isn't stuck. |
| **Effect application fails** | Log error, continue muster. Warning in summary: "Some effects may not have applied." |

**Critical Rule:** Player must never get stuck in muster menu. Any unhandled exception logs full error details and forces muster to close, resetting `_payMusterPending = false`.

## Configuration

### Muster Timing

**File:** `ModuleData/Enlisted/enlisted_config.json`

```json
{
  "payday_interval_days": 12
}
```

Controls how often muster occurs. Default 12 days with ±1 day jitter.

### Time Control

**File:** `ModuleData/Enlisted/settings.json`

```json
{
  "PauseGameDuringMuster": true
}
```

Controls whether game time pauses during muster (true = pause, false = preserve player's time speed).

### Event Cooldowns

Recruit events have cooldowns to prevent repetition:

| Event | Cooldown | Requirement |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Green Recruit | 10 days | Tier 3+ |
