# Companion Management System

**Summary:** The companion management system governs how personal heroes (companions) are handled during enlistment, controlling their location (stay in clan party or join player), battle participation eligibility, formation assignment (unified squad with player), and command restrictions to prevent players from issuing orders during enlisted service.

## Overview

Companions remain your personal assets throughout your military career. They stay in your roster from the moment of enlistment (T1) and serve alongside you in your designated formation.

---

## Companion Location

Unlike vanilla mechanics where companions might be separated, Enlisted keeps your heroes close:
-   **Immediate Transfer**: Upon enlistment, all companions are moved to the player's personal party roster.
-   **Persistence**: They remain in your roster for the entire duration of your service, even during grace periods or while on leave.
-   **Security**: If you are captured, your "Stay Back" companions remain safe in your deactivated roster and rejoin you upon release.

---

## Battle Participation

You have full control over which companions risk their lives in the lord's battles.

### Settings (Managed via Camp Menu)
-   **Fight (Default)**: The companion spawns in your formation, gains XP, and is subject to wounds or death.
-   **Stay Back**: The companion remains in the roster and does not spawn in the mission. They are immune to battle outcomes and do not gain combat experience.

### Use Cases
-   Protecting a non-combat medic or specialist.
-   Managing wound recovery for valuable heroes.
-   Avoiding risk during overwhelming odds.

## Unified Squad Formation

In all battles, your active companions and your retinue (T7+) form a single, cohesive unit.
-   **Assignment**: All squad members are automatically assigned to your current formation (e.g., Infantry, Ranged).
-   **Deployment**: They spawn at your side or are teleported to your position during reinforcement phases.
-   **Direct Command**: You can issue orders to your squad using standard formation command keys.

---

## Command Restrictions

To maintain the authenticity of the chain of command, companions are restricted from high-level leadership roles while you are enlisted:
-   **No Captaincy**: Companions cannot be assigned as captains of other formations.
-   **No Generalship**: Companions cannot lead the army or command the team.
-   **Sergeant Level**: They serve as elite fighters within your specific squad.
