## How It All Works (End-to-End)

### 1) Enlist
Enlist with a lord to begin your career. Your party is hidden, and you follow the lord's movements on the campaign map.
- Doc: **[Enlistment System](enlistment.md)**

### 2) Initial Inspection: Bag Check
About one hour after enlisting, you must decide what to do with your personal gear: stash it (paid), sell it, smuggle it (skill check), or abort enlistment entirely.
- Doc: **[Enlistment System](enlistment.md)** (Behavior section)

### 3) Receive Orders
Instead of passive assignments, you receive explicit **Orders** from the chain of command every 3-5 days (config-driven). Success builds your reputation; failure damages it.
- Doc: **[Core Gameplay](core-gameplay.md)** (Orders System section)

### 4) Build Your Identity
Your role emerges from native Bannerlord traits that develop through event choices. Commander 10+ becomes Officer, ScoutSkills 10+ becomes Scout, Surgery 10+ becomes Medic, etc. We track your reputation with the Lord, the Officers, and your fellow Soldiers.
- Doc: **[Core Gameplay](core-gameplay.md)** (Emergent Identity section)
- Doc: **[Identity System](../Identity/identity-system.md)** (Complete trait reference)

### 5) Strategic Context & War Stance
The unit's experience is now strategically aware. Your orders and events reflect the lord's actual campaign plans, whether you're in a "Grand Campaign" offensive or a "Winter Camp" rest period.
- Doc: **[Core Gameplay](core-gameplay.md)** (Strategic Context section)

### 6) Monitor Company Status
The unit's effectiveness is tracked via five core needs: Readiness, Morale, Supplies, Equipment, and Rest. The **Company Status Report** provides immersive descriptions of each need with contextual explanations.
- Doc: **[News & Reporting System](../UI/news-reporting-system.md)** (Company Status section)

### 7) Read the Daily Brief
Each day, the **Daily Brief** summarizes your company's situation, casualties, supply status, recent events, and kingdom news in immersive narrative form.
- Doc: **[News & Reporting System](../UI/news-reporting-system.md)** (Daily Brief section)

### 8) Visit the Quartermaster
The Quartermaster is your primary contact for gear and provisions. Access is gated by your reputation and the unit's supply levels.
- Doc: **[Quartermaster System](../Equipment/quartermaster-system.md)**
