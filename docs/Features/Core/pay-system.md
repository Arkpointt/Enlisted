## Daily Wage Calculation

Daily wages are calculated using a formula from `enlisted_config.json` that scales with your progression.

### Wage Formula

```
DailyWage = (BaseWage + Level×LevelMult + Tier×TierMult + XP/XPDivisor) × Modifiers
```

**Config Values** (from `enlisted_config.json`):
- `base_wage`: 10
- `level_multiplier`: 1
- `tier_multiplier`: 5
- `xp_divisor`: 200
- Minimum: 24 denars/day
- Maximum: 150 denars/day

### Example Calculations

| Tier | Level | XP | Base Formula | Daily Wage |
|------|-------|----|--------------|-----------:|
| T1 | 5 | 0 | 10 + 5×1 + 1×5 + 0 | 20 denars |
| T3 | 10 | 600 | 10 + 10×1 + 3×5 + 3 | 38 denars |
| T5 | 15 | 2000 | 10 + 15×1 + 5×5 + 10 | 60 denars |
| T7 | 20 | 5000 | 10 + 20×1 + 7×5 + 25 | 90 denars |
| T9 | 25 | 10000 | 10 + 25×1 + 9×5 + 50 | 130 denars |

### Active Modifiers

- **Army Bonus**: ×1.2 when your lord's party is in an active army (config: `army_bonus_multiplier`)
- **Probation Penalty**: ×0.5 when on probation after desertion or washout (config: `probation_wage_multiplier`)

---

## Pay Muster

Every 12 days (±1 day jitter from config), a pay muster event triggers. Payment is delivered via the multi-stage muster system, which provides comprehensive context including service record, period summary, and rank progression. See [Muster System](muster-system.md) for complete muster flow.

### Payment Options

When muster arrives, players proceed to the Pay Line stage where they choose from several payment options:

**1. Accept Your Pay (Standard Payment)**
- Lord's financial status determines actual outcome:
  - **Full Payment**: Lord pays all pending wages plus any backpay. Pay Tension reduced by 30. Clears consecutive delay counter.
  - **Partial Payment**: Lord pays current period + 50% of backpay. Pay Tension reduced by 10. Remaining backpay carries forward.
  - **Payment Delayed**: Lord cannot afford wages. Backpay accumulates. Pay Tension increases (10 base + 5 per week overdue).

**2. Demand a Recount (Corruption)**
- Roguery/Charm skill check to extract more coin (95% payout) through creative accounting
- Costs 10 fatigue on attempt
- Risk of lord relation penalty if failed

**3. Quartermaster's Deal**
- Lottery system: 70% base chance for surplus equipment (modified by QM rep)
- Take 40% of wages + chance at equipment
- **QM Rep Modifiers:**
  - Rep 75+: 85% chance (base +15%)
  - Rep 50-74: 75% chance (base +5%)
  - Rep 25-49: 70% chance (base)
  - Rep <25: 60% chance (base -10%)
- **Equipment Selection:**
  - 90% chance: Current tier equipment
  - 10% chance: Tier +1 equipment (capped at T9)
  - Weighted by player skills (OneHanded → swords, Bow → bows, etc.)
  - Item added directly to inventory, exempt from contraband checks
- On failure: Still receive 40% pay
- Costs 6 fatigue
- Always available

**4. Accept Payment in Arrears**
- **Only available when lord cannot afford to pay**
- Accept delayed payment until next regular muster
- Wages remain owed, no immediate gold
- Eases lord's finances, avoids tension increase
- Next payday set to next regular muster cycle (12 days)

### Discharge Options

If the player has a pending discharge, additional options appear:

**5. Process Final Discharge**
- Receive final pay settlement
- Service ends, pension activated
- Equipment reclaimed (see [Discharge System](onboarding-discharge-system.md))

**6. Smuggle Out (Deserter)**
- Keep all gear, lose pension
- Deserter penalties applied
- Criminal record and faction hostility

**5. Process Final Discharge**
- **Only available if pending discharge requested**
- Ends service honorably
- Pays final wages + severance based on service band
- Activates pension system

**6. Smuggle Out (Deserter)**
- **Only available if pending discharge requested**
- Ends service as deserter
- Keep all current equipment
- Lose pension eligibility
- Face desertion penalties (lord relation hit, crime rating)

### Lord Wealth Checks

Lord affordability is checked with buffers to prevent draining them:
- Full payment: `LordGold >= Amount + 500`
- Partial payment: `LordGold >= (Amount/2) + 200`

Wealth thresholds for reference:
- Wealthy: >50,000 denars
- Comfortable: >20,000 denars
- Struggling: >5,000 denars
- Poor: >1,000 denars
- Broke: ≤1,000 denars

## Pay Tension (0-100)

Tracks soldier dissatisfaction when pay is delayed or irregular.

### Tension Increases

- **Pay Delayed**: 10 base + 5 per week overdue
- **Consecutive Delays**: Compounds tension buildup
- **Max Value**: 100

### Tension Decreases

- **Full Payment**: -30 tension
- **Partial Payment**: -10 tension
- **Player Assists Lord**: Custom reduction from events

### Effects by Level

| Tension | Morale Penalty | Discipline Risk | NPC Desertion Risk |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 0-19 | None | None | None |
| 20-39 | -3 | None | None |
| 40-59 | -6 | +5% chance | Low |
| 60-79 | -10 | +10% chance | Medium |
| 80+ | -15 | +20% chance | High |

When tension reaches 80+, NPC soldiers may desert from the lord's party. The player can check tension in the Camp Hub menu.

**Note:** Desertion for the player is determined at muster as a discharge outcome, not through a player action. High pay tension affects NPC morale and lord party stability, but players must go through the muster discharge process.

## Battle Loot Share

Enlisted soldiers receive automatic gold payouts after victories based on tier. This compensates for restricted loot access at lower ranks.

### Loot Share Formula

```
EstimatedLoot = EnemyCasualties × 20 denars
LootPool = EstimatedLoot × 0.5 (T1-T6) or EstimatedLoot (T7-T9)
GoldEarned = LootPool × SharePercent + VictoryBonus
```

### Share Percentages by Tier

| Tier | Share % | Pool Type | Example (100 casualties) |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| T1 | 5% | Troop (50%) | 50 denars |
| T2 | 10% | Troop (50%) | 100 denars |
| T3 | 10% | Troop (50%) | 100 denars |
| T4 | 15% | Troop (50%) | 150 denars |
| T5 | 15% | Troop (50%) | 150 denars |
| T6 | 15% | Troop (50%) | 150 denars |
| T7 | 10% | Total (100%) | 200 denars |
| T8 | 15% | Total (100%) | 300 denars |
| T9 | 20% | Total (100%) | 400 denars |

**Victory Bonus**: 5-20 denars based on battle size (5 + casualties/10, max 20)

**Commander Privilege (T7+)**: Commanders take their share from total loot before the lord's split, representing their command authority.

---

## Tier-Gated Loot

| Tier | Loot Access | Compensation |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| T1-T3 | **Blocked** | Automatic gold share only |
| T4-T6 | **Allowed** | Native loot screens + gold share |
| T7-T9 | **Allowed** | Native loot screens + commander share |

T4+ soldiers can use the standard Bannerlord post-battle loot interface and still receive their automatic gold share on top of any loot they take.

---

## Automatic Ration Exchange

After pay resolution, the system automatically processes ration exchange for T1-T6 enlisted personnel:

**Ration Exchange Process:**
1. **Reclamation**: Previously issued rations removed from inventory (prevents hoarding)
2. **Issue Check**: Supply level determines availability
   - Supply >= 30%: Ration issued
   - Supply < 30%: No ration, warning displayed
3. **New Ration**: Tier-appropriate food item issued based on QM reputation:
   - QM Rep 80+: Meat (high value)
   - QM Rep 50-79: Cheese (good value)
   - QM Rep 20-49: Butter (moderate value)
   - QM Rep <20: Grain (low value)

**T7+ Commanders:**
- Exempt from ration exchange (provision their own retinue)
- Any outstanding enlisted rations reclaimed on promotion

See [Muster Menu System](muster-menu-revamp.md) for full muster flow details.

## News Integration

Pay muster outcomes are recorded to the Personal Feed for historical review. Players can track their payment history and identify patterns like repeated delays.

### Personal Feed Entries

Each muster generates an outcome-specific headline:

| Outcome | Personal Feed Entry |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Full Payment** | "The paymaster counts out your coin. {AMOUNT} denars received in full." |
| **Partial Payment** | "The paymaster's purse is light. {AMOUNT} denars paid, {OWED} still owed." |
| **Delayed** | "The paymaster shakes his head. No coin today. {OWED} denars now owed." |
| **Promissory Note** | "A promissory note replaces coin. The lord's seal promises payment soon." |
| **Corruption** | "Coin changes hands in the shadows. {AMOUNT} denars, and no questions asked." |
| **Side Deal** | "A deal was struck aside the muster line. {AMOUNT} denars, quick and quiet." |

### Implementation

Called from `EnlistmentBehavior` payment processing methods:

```csharp
// In ProcessFullPayment, ProcessPartialPayment, ProcessPayDelay
EnlistedNewsBehavior.Instance?.AddPayMusterNews(outcome, amountPaid, amountOwed);
```

Localization strings use `News_PayMuster_{Outcome}` keys in `enlisted_strings.xml`.

### Player Value

This historical record helps players:
- Identify lords who consistently fail to pay
- Track total backpay owed over time
- Make informed decisions about service continuation
- Understand why Pay Tension might be elevated
