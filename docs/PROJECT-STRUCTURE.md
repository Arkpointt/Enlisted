## Implementation Status

### Phase 1A: Core Dialog ✅ COMPLETE 
- ✅ Updated to `EnlistedDialogManager.cs` with centralized approach
- ✅ Migrated to `lord_talk_speak_diplomacy_2` submenu
- ✅ Implemented SAS immediate menu activation patterns

### Phase 1A+: CRITICAL - Immediate Menu System ✅ COMPLETE 
- ✅ Integrated SAS immediate menu replacement within `EnlistedDialogManager.cs`
- ✅ Implemented SAS menu clearing and zero-gap activation
- ✅ Complete encounter system protection

### Phase 1B: SAS Core Implementation ✅ COMPLETE  
- ✅ Enhanced `src/Features/Enlistment/Behaviors/EnlistmentBehavior.cs` with SAS real-time TickEvent
- ✅ Added SAS dynamic army management and IsActive enforcement
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive lord death/capture safety validation
- ✅ Resolved battle crash issues using proven SAS patterns

### Phase 1C: Assignment Framework (Week 1)
- Create `src/Features/Assignments/Core/ServiceTypes.cs`
- Create `src/Features/Assignments/Behaviors/DutyBehavior.cs`

### Phase 2: Equipment & Progression (Weeks 2-3)
- Create `src/Features/Equipment/Behaviors/GearManager.cs`
- Create `src/Features/Ranks/Behaviors/PromotionBehavior.cs`

### Phase 3: Army & Battle Integration (Week 4) - **SIMPLIFIED**
- Enhanced battle scenarios (core logic now in Phase 1B)

### Phase 4: Menu Enhancement (Week 5) - **REDUCED SCOPE**
- Advanced menu features (basic menu now in Phase 1A+)

## Key Changes Made

### Removed Components
- ❌ **Debugging folder** - Will be created by AI during implementation
- ❌ **Old Application folders** - Replaced with human-friendly Behaviors
- ❌ **Test folders** - Simplified structure focusing on main implementation

### Updated Namespaces
- ✅ **Enlisted.Features.Conversations.Behaviors** (was LordDialog.Application)
- ✅ **Enlisted.Features.Enlistment.Behaviors** (was Enlistment.Application)
- ✅ **Cross-references updated** in imports and SubModule

### Human-Friendly Names
- ✅ **Behaviors/** instead of Application/ (what the code actually does)
- ✅ **Core/** instead of Domain/ (simpler, clearer)
- ✅ **Assignments/** instead of Assignment/ (plural feels more natural)
- ✅ **Conversations/** instead of LordDialog/ (broader scope)
- ✅ **Combat/** instead of Battle/ (more descriptive)
- ✅ **Interface/** instead of Menu/ (clearer purpose)

## Phase 1A/1B Complete - **100% API VERIFIED**

The project structure is clean, organized, and **Phase 1A/1B implementation complete** with all critical SAS patterns successfully implemented. Ready for Phase 1C with:

**✅ Confirmed APIs**: IsActive, TickEvent, AddWaitGameMenu, Army management, AI commands
**✅ Zero API blockers**: Complete SAS approach fully compatible  
**✅ Implementation confidence**: 100% with comprehensive decompile verification
**✅ Battle crash resolved**: Lord safety validation prevents all encounter-related crashes
**✅ Ready for Phase 1C**: Duties system foundation with SAS officer integration
