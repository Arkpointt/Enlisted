# CrewAI Planning Documents

This folder contains planning documents generated by CrewAI agents for proposed features.

## Purpose

Planning documents created here represent **ideas and designs that are not yet implemented**. They allow exploration of features before committing to implementation.

## Document Lifecycle

### Status: 📋 Planning
- Feature is being designed
- No code exists yet
- Document lives in this folder

### Status: 🚧 In Progress  
- Implementation has started
- Move to `docs/ANEWFEATURE/` if appropriate

### Status: ✅ Implemented
- Feature is complete
- Move to `docs/Features/` organized by system

## Intelligent Versioning

The `write_planning_doc_tool` handles versioning automatically:

### First Creation
```
reputation-morale-supply-integration.md
```

### Minor Updates (>70% similar content)
- **Updates existing file** with revision timestamp
- Use when refining details or clarifying existing design
- Previous versions not preserved (iterative refinement)

### Major Rewrites (<70% similar content)
- **Creates new version file**
- Preserves previous version
```
reputation-morale-supply-integration.md      <- Original
reputation-morale-supply-integration-v2.md   <- Major revision
reputation-morale-supply-integration-v3.md   <- Another major change
```

## When to Create vs Update

### Create New Version When:
- Complete design pivot (different approach)
- After implementation (planning for phase 2)
- Significant scope change
- Exploring alternative architectures

### Update Existing When:
- Fixing typos or clarity
- Adding missing details to existing sections
- Refining data models
- Updating based on research findings

## Running the Planning Crew

```bash
cd Tools/CrewAI
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python plan_your_feature.py
```

The crew will:
1. Research existing systems
2. Draft comprehensive design
3. **Automatically save** to this folder with versioning
