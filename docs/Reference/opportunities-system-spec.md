## This Document Is Outdated

This specification described an older "Opportunities" system concept that has been **replaced** by the Content Orchestrator and Camp Life Simulation.

**Old System (This Doc):**
- Opportunities appeared in Camp Hub "OPPORTUNITIES" section
- Used trigger evaluation on `events_decisions.json`
- Menu-based selection of automatic decisions

**New System (Active):**
- DECISIONS menu in Main Menu (accessed via enlisted_status)
- Orchestrator-driven, context-aware camp opportunities
- Fitness scoring, learning system, order-decision tension
- See [Camp Life Simulation](../AFEATURE/camp-life-simulation.md)
