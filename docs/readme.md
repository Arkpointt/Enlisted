## Major Achievements

### Working Gauntlet Grid UI ‚úÖ 
**Date**: 2025-09-06 - Major breakthrough in Bannerlord modding

We figured out how to create working Gauntlet grid UIs using current v1.2.12 APIs:
- **Individual equipment clicking**: Each variant has its own Select/Preview buttons
- **Equipment images**: Proper item icons using `ImageIdentifierVM` 
- **4K resolution support**: Responsive design that scales correctly
- **Rich weapon details**: Shows culture, class, tier, damage stats
- **No crashes or freezing**: Proper input handling and template registration

**Technical discoveries:**
- Templates go in `GUI/Prefabs/{FeatureName}/` (official Bannerlord structure)
- Need `TaleWorlds.PlayerServices.dll` for equipment images
- Register hotkeys BEFORE input restrictions or game freezes
- Use `<Widget>` not `<Panel>` (Panel is deprecated)
- Use center alignment for multi-resolution support

### Other Key Features ‚úÖ
- **Real troop selection**: Choose actual Bannerlord troops, get their equipment
- **Encounter safety**: `IsActive = false` prevents map crashes during service
- **Centralized dialogs**: Single manager prevents conversation conflicts
- **JSON configuration**: Military duties configurable without recompiling
- **Real-time processing**: Works even when game is paused

**The system automatically detects your Bannerlord installation and creates the debugging folder there.**

### **Log File Organization** (Session-Scoped)
```
<BannerlordInstall>\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enlisted.log                    # Bootstrap, init details, critical errors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discovery.log                   # Menu opens, settlement events, session markers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dialog.log                      # Dialog availability/selection events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.log                         # Menu transition API notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attributed_menus.txt             # Unique menu IDs observed (aggregated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dialog_tokens.txt               # Unique dialog tokens observed (aggregated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api_surface.txt                 # Reflection dump of public surfaces
```

### **Automatic Path Detection Implementation**
```csharp
// Works on ANY Bannerlord installation
public static class LogPath
{
    private static string _debuggingPath;
    
    public static string GetDebuggingPath()
    {
        if (_debuggingPath == null)
        {
            var assemblyPath = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location;
            var modulePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(Path.GetDirectoryName(assemblyPath));
            _debuggingPath = Path.Combine(modulePath, "Debugging");
            Directory.CreateDirectory(_debuggingPath);
        }
        return _debuggingPath;

## üéØ **Complete Implementation Summary**

### **‚úÖ Enhanced vs. Original SAS**
| Feature | Original SAS | Our Enhanced System |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Formations** | 4 basic detection | **4 with enhanced specializations & culture variants** |
| **Equipment** | Single kit per tier | **3-6 troop choices per tier with realistic pricing** |
| **Menu System** | Basic equipment selector | **Complete military interface with sub-menus** |
| **Healing** | Settlement-dependent | **Simplified anywhere access + custom healing model** |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded values | **7 JSON files with schema versioning & validation** |
| **Localization** | Basic text | **Professional {=key}fallback multi-language support** |
| **Officer Roles** | 37+ Harmony patches | **4 targeted patches with natural skill integration** |

### **‚úÖ 4-Formation System** (Enhanced from SAS)
**Auto-Detection Logic** (matches original SAS):
```csharp
if (Hero.MainHero.CharacterObject.IsRanged && Hero.MainHero.CharacterObject.IsMounted)
    return TroopType.HorseArcher;   // Bow + Horse
else if (Hero.MainHero.CharacterObject.IsMounted)
    return TroopType.Cavalry;       // Sword + Horse
else if (Hero.MainHero.CharacterObject.IsRanged)
    return TroopType.Archer;        // Bow + No Horse
else
    return TroopType.Infantry;      // Sword + No Horse (default)
```

**Culture-Specific Formation Names**:
- **Empire**: Legionary, Sagittarius, Equites, Equites Sagittarii
- **Khuzait**: Spearman, Hunter, Lancer, Horse Archer
- **Vlandia**: Man-at-Arms, Crossbowman, Knight, Mounted Crossbowman

### **‚úÖ Realistic Equipment Economics**
| Tier | Infantry | Archer | Cavalry | Horse Archer |
|------|----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **T1** | 75ü™ô | 98ü™ô | 150ü™ô | 188ü™ô |
| **T3** | 225ü™ô | 293ü™ô | 450ü™ô | 563ü™ô |
| **T5** | 375ü™ô | 488ü™ô | 750ü™ô | 938ü™ô |
| **T7 Elite** | 788ü™ô | 1024ü™ô | 1575ü™ô | 1969ü™ô |

## üõ°Ô∏è **Critical Crash Analysis & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Lord Death/Army Defeat Crashes**

#### **Problem Identified:**
- **Crash logs**: `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\crashes\2025-09-05_17.42.06\`
- **Scenario**: When lord dies or army is defeated during daily tick processing
- **Root Cause**: Missing event handlers for `CharacterDefeated`, `HeroKilledEvent`, `OnArmyDispersed`

#### **Solution Implemented:**
```csharp
// Added missing event registrations in RegisterEvents():
CampaignEvents.HeroKilledEvent.AddNonSerializedListener(this, OnHeroKilled);
CampaignEvents.CharacterDefeated.AddNonSerializedListener(this, OnCharacterDefeated);
CampaignEvents.ArmyDispersed.AddNonSerializedListener(this, OnArmyDispersed);
CampaignEvents.HeroPrisonerTaken.AddNonSerializedListener(this, OnHeroPrisonerTaken);

// Event-driven immediate response prevents crashes
private void OnCharacterDefeated(Hero defeatedHero, Hero victorHero) {
    if (IsEnlisted && defeatedHero == _enlistedLord) {
        StopEnlist("Lord died in battle"); // Immediate safe discharge
    }
}
```

#### **Key Learning:**
**SAS relied on event-driven safety, not continuous polling.** When armies are defeated, events fire immediately - we must respond instantly to clean up invalid lord references before daily tick tries to access them.

### **Issue 2: Pathfinding Crash (Introduced During Fix)**

#### **Problem Identified:**
- **Crash logs**: `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\crashes\ak0kr0m5.41x\2025-09-05_18.58.56`
- **Error**: `Assertion Failed! Expression: Inaccessible target point for party path finding`
- **Root Cause**: Added complex `SetMoveEscortParty()` calls bypassing EncounterGuard safety

#### **Failed Solution (Over-Engineering):**
```csharp
// ‚ùå BROKE: Complex army management with direct escort calls
private void HandleArmyMembership(...) {
    if (lordArmy != null) {
        main.Ai.SetMoveEscortParty(armyLeader); // CRASH: when army leader in settlement!
    }
}
```

#### **Working Solution (Revert to Simple):**
```csharp
// ‚úÖ WORKS: Original simple approach with built-in safety
EncounterGuard.TryAttachOrEscort(_enlistedLord); // Has pathfinding protection built-in
```

#### **Key Learning:**
**Original working code was simple and elegant.** `EncounterGuard.TryAttachOrEscort()` already had built-in pathfinding safety. Complex "enhancements" broke working systems by bypassing proven safety mechanisms.

### **Issue 3: Battle Participation Missing**

#### **Problem Identified:**
- **User Report**: "Not getting prompted with encounter menu when pulled into battle"
- **Root Cause**: Missing real-time battle detection logic
- **Timeline**: Should have been in Phase 1B but was incomplete

#### **Solution Implemented:**
```csharp
// Added real-time battle detection in OnRealtimeTick():
private void HandleBattleParticipation(MobileParty main, MobileParty lordParty) {
    bool lordInBattle = lordParty.MapEvent != null;
    if (lordInBattle && !main.MapEvent) {
        main.IsActive = true;  // Trigger encounter menu
    }
}
```

#### **Key Learning:**
**Battle participation requires real-time detection**, not just setting `ShouldJoinPlayerBattles = true`. Must actively monitor `lordParty.MapEvent` and enable player when lord enters combat.

### **üîß Final Architecture Guidelines for Future Development:**

#### **‚úÖ Working Escort Pattern:**
```csharp
// DO: Use EncounterGuard (has built-in safety)
EncounterGuard.TryAttachOrEscort(_enlistedLord);

// DON'T: Direct SetMoveEscortParty calls (causes pathfinding crashes)
main.Ai.SetMoveEscortParty(lordParty); // ‚ùå Crashes when lord in settlement/battle
```

#### **‚úÖ Working Safety Pattern:**
```csharp
// DO: Event-driven immediate response
CampaignEvents.CharacterDefeated.AddNonSerializedListener(this, OnCharacterDefeated);

// DON'T: Continuous polling only (too slow for crash scenarios)  
// Real-time validation is supplementary, not primary safety
```

#### **‚úÖ Working Battle Pattern:**
```csharp
// DO: Real-time detection with IsActive toggling
if (lordParty.MapEvent != null && !main.MapEvent) {
    main.IsActive = true; // Enable for battle
}

// DON'T: Rely only on ShouldJoinPlayerBattles property
```
