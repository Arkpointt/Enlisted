# Implementation Overview

Last updated: 2025-09-06

## What We Built

Military service system for Bannerlord where you can enlist with lords and progress through ranks.

**Core features:**
- Enlist with any lord by talking to them
- Get promoted through 7 tiers over a year of service  
- Choose real Bannerlord troops and get their equipment
- Military duties system with roles like Quartermaster, Scout, Field Medic
- Grid UI for individual equipment selection
- Works on 4K and different resolutions
- No crashes or game freezing

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Systems ✅ Complete
- **Dialog System**: Centralized conversation management in `EnlistedDialogManager.cs`  
- **Enlistment**: Join lords, follow their armies, handle edge cases safely
- **Duties System**: JSON-configured military roles with real benefits

### Phase 2: Equipment & UI ✅ Complete  
- **Troop Selection**: Pick real troops, get their equipment on promotion
- **Quartermaster Grid UI**: Individual equipment clicking with images and stats
- **Menu System**: 'N' key for enlisted status with SAS-style clean formatting, 'P' for promotions
- **Battle Commands**: Automatic formation-based command filtering with audio cues

## Major Breakthrough: Grid UI

**Date**: 2025-09-06

We figured out how to create working Gauntlet grid UIs for Bannerlord:
- Templates go in `GUI/Prefabs/{FeatureName}/` (not custom paths)
- Need `TaleWorlds.PlayerServices.dll` for equipment images
- Register hotkeys BEFORE input restrictions or game freezes  
- Use `<Widget>` not `<Panel>` (Panel is deprecated)
- Use center alignment for 4K support, not fixed margins

**Result**: Working equipment selection with individual clickable cards, just like SAS had.

## Key Technical Decisions

**Real Troops vs Equipment Kits**: Chose real troops because it's more immersive and uses existing game data.

**Encounter Safety**: Use `IsActive = false` instead of complex patches - simpler and more reliable.

**Real-Time Processing**: Use `TickEvent` not `HourlyTickEvent` so military service works even when game is paused.

**Centralized Dialogs**: One dialog manager instead of scattered conversations prevents conflicts.

**JSON Configuration**: Military duties are configurable without recompiling the mod.

## Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 3: Enhanced Battle Integration
**Goal**: Better battle participation and army coordination

**Planned features:**
- Automatic battle joining when lord fights
- Formation-specific bonuses during battles  
- Battle XP bonuses based on military role
- Army cohesion effects and benefits
- Advanced officer role benefits in combat

**Technical approach:**
- Use `MobileParty.ShouldJoinPlayerBattles` for automatic participation
- Battle event handlers for XP and formation bonuses
- Army status tracking for cohesion benefits

### Phase 4: Extended Equipment System  
**Goal**: Complete equipment management across all slots

**Planned features:**
- Helmet Quartermaster (extend grid UI to helmets)
- Armor Quartermaster (body armor, gloves, boots)
- Mount Quartermaster (horses and horse armor)
- Equipment comparison between variants
- Enhanced tooltips with detailed stat comparisons

**Technical approach:**
- Reuse existing Quartermaster UI patterns
- Extend `QuartermasterManager` for additional equipment slots
- Copy template structure for helmet/armor variants

### Phase 5: Advanced Military Features
**Goal**: Veteran progression and special systems

**Planned features:**
- Retirement benefits and equipment keeping
- Veteran status with special privileges  
- Military events and random encounters
- Advanced progression tracking and service records
- Optional vassalage offers for distinguished veterans

**Technical approach:**
- Extend existing progression system
- Add veteran-specific dialogs and benefits
- Service history tracking and display

### Phase 6: Polish and Quality of Life
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience and edge case handling

**Planned features:**
- Save/load testing and edge case fixes
- Enhanced UI animations and feedback
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Additional configuration options

## Current Status

**Complete**: Core military service system is working and ready for players.

**Next recommended phase**: Phase 3 (Enhanced Battle Integration) - builds on the solid foundation we've established.
