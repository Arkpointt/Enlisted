        <ChangeNotes Value="v0.9.0.1 - Critical Bug Fixes &amp; XP System Overhaul

[CRITICAL XP FIXES]
- Fixed 0 XP in muster reports - all activities now properly grant enlistment XP for rank progression
- Fixed combat XP not tracked - killing enemies now awards tier-scaled XP (higher tier = more XP)
- Added missing XP rewards to all 85 order events across 11 order types
- Order events: 10-32 XP per event (scales with difficulty and skill checks)
- Camp activities: 8-25 XP (training, self-treatment, muster interactions)
- Combat kills: Tier-scaled using native formula (T5 elite = 3.5x more XP than T1 recruit)
- Failed skill checks now award 50% XP (learn from mistakes)
- All XP sources tracked and displayed in muster period summary breakdown

[QUARTERMASTER FIXES]
- Fixed Quartermaster showing vanilla companion recruitment dialogue (changed Occupation to Soldier)
- Fixed Quartermaster dialogue breaking with 'custom_line_a to d Error' messages
- Fixed supply inquiry closing conversation instead of showing supply report
- Added fallback dialogue system to ensure QM always works even with corrupted installations

[DIAGNOSTICS &amp; VALIDATION]
- Enhanced conflict detection system to verify mod installation integrity
- Added module health check that detects missing/corrupt JSON and XML files
- Added runtime catalog status verification to confirm content loaded successfully
- Added validation tool checks for missing XP in order events
- Improved diagnostic logging for user bug reports with installation path detection

This update resolves widespread reports of '0 XP in muster reports' and Quartermaster dialogue errors." />
