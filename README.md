- `Events\*.json` (event content packs)
- `Orders\*.json` (military orders by tier)

### translations

the mod is fully translatable and supports multiple languages. to add a translation:

- see **[Translation Guide](ModuleData/Languages/README.md)** for complete instructions
- copy the `_TEMPLATE` folder in `ModuleData/Languages/`
- translate 1,822 strings to your language
- submit via pull request or share with the community

current languages: **english** (default)

### logs + troubleshooting

#### where logs are

**PRIMARY LOCATION (ENLISTED MOD LOGS):**

`<bannerlord>\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\`

**Example full path:**

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\`

**IMPORTANT:** The mod writes all logs directly to the `Debugging` subfolder inside the Enlisted module directory. This is NOT the game's crash logs and NOT your Documents folder.

#### installation locations

**Where the mod is installed depends on how you got it:**

**Steam Workshop:**
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\261550\3621116083\`

**Manual/Nexus Install:**
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\Enlisted\`

**NOTE:** If you have both installed, you'll see duplicates in the Bannerlord launcher. Unsubscribe from the Workshop version if you're installing manually to avoid conflicts.

#### automatic mod conflict detection

The mod automatically detects conflicts with other mods at startup. Check `Conflicts-A_{timestamp}.log` in the Debugging folder for:
- Harmony patch conflicts with other mods
- Module health check (missing/corrupt JSON/XML files)
- Runtime catalog status (content loading verification)
- Patch application status (total methods patched)
- Installation path information (manual vs Steam Workshop)

This comprehensive diagnostic log helps quickly identify whether issues are due to mod conflicts, corrupted installations, or genuine bugs.

**files you should share when reporting issues:**
- `Session-A_{timestamp}.log` (latest session)
- `Conflicts-A_{timestamp}.log` (latest conflicts report)
- `Current_Session_README.txt` (points to the current files and explains what to share)

**note:** The mod no longer creates `enlisted.log` or `conflicts.log` (legacy filenames). All logs use timestamped Session-A/B/C and Conflicts-A/B/C rotation.

**fallback location (only if the mod can't write to the module folder):**
- `%userprofile%\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Logs\Enlisted\`

**bannerlord crash dumps (separate - when the game itself hard-crashes):**
- `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\crashes\`

#### error codes (important)

when something breaks, enlisted will often log a **stable error code** like:
- `[E-CAMPUI-031] Failed to display Camp Area screen`

these codes are meant to be searchable and consistent across versions.
when reporting an issue, please include:
- the **error code(s)** you see (copy/paste the lines)
- `Session-A_*.log`

note: exceptions include **full stack traces**, but they’re **de-duplicated** (the first occurrence per unique exception in a session) to avoid log spam.

also note: some issues are intentionally logged **once per session** (look for codes beginning with `E-` or `W-` in a single line), especially for:
- **dlc missing / feature gating** (example: `W-DLC-001`, `W-DLC-002`)
- **reflection / api drift** where a patch can’t apply (example: `W-REFLECT-001`)
- **ui fallback paths** (example: `E-QM-014`)
- **save/load wrappers + migrations** (example: `E-SAVELOAD-001`, `E-SAVELOAD-002`)

#### common issues

- **mod menu options don’t show**
  - confirm `bannerlord.harmony` is enabled and loaded before enlisted.
- **war sails / naval features don’t work**
  - if you don’t have the War Sails (NavalDLC) expansion enabled, naval-only features will be gated.
  - check the session log for a `W-DLC-*` warning.
- **events don’t fire**
  - confirm the event systems are enabled in `enlisted_config.json`.
- **something feels “stuck” after leaving a menu/encounter**
  - send `Session-A_*.log` + your mod list/load order.
- **save won’t load / loads into broken state**
  - check for `E-SAVELOAD-*` in `Session-A_*.log`, then share the session log + conflicts log (and the save file if possible).
