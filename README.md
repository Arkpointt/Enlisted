`<BannerlordInstall>\Modules\Enlisted\Debugging\` [[memory:7845841]]

**Note**: Works on any drive (C:, D:, E:, etc.) - automatically detects your Bannerlord installation location

Files created per session:
- `enlisted.log` – bootstrap and general info
- `discovery.log` – menu opens, settlement entries, session markers
- `dialog.log` – dialog availability and selections (CampaignGameStarter + DialogFlow hooks)
